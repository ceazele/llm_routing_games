System: 
You're Matthew Lewis, a 31-year-old construction worker.
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 10 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O A B D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-A, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-B, cost function: 210
Segment A-D, cost function: 210
Segment B-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-A-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-A to travel from O to A plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment A-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-B-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment B-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-A and B-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments A-D and O-B is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-A-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-B-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 X 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-B-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-A-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 X 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 10 rounds have exactly the same structure.


Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a decision that optimizes my payoff, I need to carefully consider the cost structure of the available routes in the game. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how I'll make the decision:

1. **Understand the Cost Functions:**
   - Route O-A-D: Cost = 10 * X + 210
   - Route O-B-D: Cost = 210 + 10 * Y
   - X = Number of participants choosing route O-A-D
   - Y = Number of participants choosing route O-B-D

2. **Analyze the Scenarios:**
   - If I choose O-A-D:
     - My cost will be higher if many participants choose O-A-D.
     - Lowest cost if I am the only one: 10 * 1 + 210 = 220
   - If I choose O-B-D:
     - My cost will be higher if many participants choose O-B-D.
     - Lowest cost if I am the only one: 210 + 10 * 1 = 220

3. **Estimate the Behavior of Other Participants:**
   - Since there are 18 participants, it's likely that not everyone will choose the same route. 
   - Participants aiming to minimize their personal costs may distribute themselves somewhat evenly across the two routes over multiple rounds.

4. **Decision-Making Strategy:**
   - In the initial round, without prior data, making a guess based on balance might be a reasonable strategy.
   - In later rounds, using data from previous rounds will inform whether a majority prefers one route over another, influencing my future decisions.
   
5. **Choosing the Route:**
   - For the first round, I will assume a balanced distribution and choose a route expecting a near-equal split of participants across both options.

Given the symmetry and considering that many participants will try to avoid congestion, I'll make an initial balanced choice.

JSON Output:
```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

This choice is based on reasoning that the costs will likely be similar, but starting with O-B-D may yield lower costs if others are more inclined to initially choose O-A-D.

In subsequent rounds, I will adjust my strategy based on actual data about other participants' choices.

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 10, 'O-B-D': 8}
Your payoff was 110

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the information from the last round, we can make a more informed decision for this round. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Review Last Round Data:**
   - Number of players on route O-A-D: 10
   - Number of players on route O-B-D: 8
   - Your payoff: 110 (meaning your travel cost was 290)

2. **Calculate Costs from Last Round:**
   - Your travel cost last round: 400 (endowment) - 110 (payoff) = 290
   - Since your cost was 290 and you earned this payoff, you must have chosen route O-B-D.
   - Let's verify:
     - O-B-D cost calculation: 210 (fixed) + 10 * 8 (number of players on B-D) = 210 + 80 = 290
     
3. **Predicting the Next Round:**
   - From the previous choices, there is a slight tendency for more players to choose O-A-D.
   - The costs were: 
     - For O-A-D players: 10 * 10 (O-A) + 210 = 100 + 210 = 310
     - For O-B-D players: 210 + 10 * 8 = 210 + 80 = 290
   - The higher cost of O-A-D last round (310) might push some players to switch to O-B-D.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Expecting a minor shift of players from O-A-D to O-B-D due to prior higher costs, the segment O-B-D might get more crowded.
   - Choosing O-A-D this round might therefore incur a lower cost given the potential shift in player behavior.
   
Based on this analysis, it's reasonable to choose route O-A-D for this round, anticipating reduced congestion as more players might opt for O-B-D to avoid the previously higher costs of route O-A-D.

JSON Output:
```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

This choice is strategically aimed at balancing the participant load between routes, thus reducing overall travel costs and maximizing payoff.

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 13, 'O-B-D': 5}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the new data from the last round, let's analyze and make a well-informed decision for this round.

1. **Review Last Round Data:**
   - Number of players on route O-A-D: 13
   - Number of players on route O-B-D: 5
   - Your payoff was 60, meaning your travel cost was 340 (400 - 60)

2. **Calculate Costs from Last Round:**
   - Since your cost was 340, you must have chosen route O-A-D last round.
   - Let's verify:
     - O-A-D cost calculation: 10 * 13 (O-A) + 210 = 130 + 210 = 340

3. **Predicting the Next Round:**
   - From the previous choices, we can see that significantly more players chose O-A-D.
   - The costs for the routes last round were:
     - For O-A-D: 340 (as calculated earlier)
     - For O-B-D: 210 + 10 * 5 = 210 + 50 = 260
   - Given the high cost of O-A-D last round, it's likely that some players will switch to route O-B-D to minimize their travel cost.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Expecting a shift from O-A-D to O-B-D by some players who experienced high costs.
   - Considering the trend, more players are likely to avoid O-A-D due to its high cost.
   - Therefore, choosing route O-B-D might distribute the load more evenly, reducing the expected congestion and cost.

Based on this analysis, it makes strategic sense to choose route O-B-D for this round to align with the likely adjustment of other participants and to potentially benefit from a lower cost.

JSON Output:
```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

This choice anticipates a shift of some players to O-B-D, aiming for a balanced distribution of players and minimizing the overall travel cost.

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 6, 'O-B-D': 12}
Your payoff was 70

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the data from the last round, let's analyze and make a well-informed decision for this round.

1. **Review Last Round Data:**
   - Number of players on route O-A-D: 6
   - Number of players on route O-B-D: 12
   - Your payoff was 70, meaning your travel cost was 330 (400 - 70)

2. **Calculate Costs from Last Round:**
   - Since your cost was 330, you must have chosen route O-B-D last round.
   - Let's verify:
     - O-B-D cost calculation: 210 (fixed) + 10 * 12 (number of players on B-D) = 210 + 120 = 330

3. **Predicting the Next Round:**
   - From the previous choices, it’s evident that more players switched to O-B-D, leading to higher congestion and higher costs.
   - The costs for the routes last round were:
     - For O-A-D players: 10 * 6 (O-A) + 210 = 60 + 210 = 270
     - For O-B-D players: 210 + 10 * 12 = 210 + 120 = 330
   - Given the high cost of O-B-D last round, it's likely that some players will switch back to route O-A-D to minimize their travel cost.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Expecting a shift from O-B-D to O-A-D by some players who experienced high costs.
   - Considering the trend, more players will likely avoid O-B-D due to its higher cost.
   - Therefore, choosing route O-A-D might distribute the load more evenly, reducing the expected congestion and cost.

Based on this ongoing trend and analysis, it makes strategic sense to choose route O-A-D for this round to align with the likely adjustment of other participants and to potentially benefit from a lower cost.

JSON Output:
```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

This choice aligns with the expectation of participants shifting back to route O-A-D, aiming for a balanced distribution of players and minimizing overall travel costs.

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 9, 'O-B-D': 9}
Your payoff was 100

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the data from the last round, let's analyze and make a well-informed decision for this round.

1. **Review Last Round Data:**
   - Number of players on route O-A-D: 9
   - Number of players on route O-B-D: 9
   - Your payoff was 100, meaning your travel cost was 300 (400 - 100).

2. **Calculate Costs from Last Round:**
   - Since the costs are balanced, we can infer the costs for both routes:
     - O-A-D cost calculation: 10 * 9 (O-A) + 210 = 90 + 210 = 300
     - O-B-D cost calculation: 210 + 10 * 9 (B-D) = 210 + 90 = 300

3. **Predicting the Next Round:**
   - Since both routes had equal participants and equal costs, players might feel indifferent between routes or might slightly lean towards one route or another based on previous round experience.
   - The equilibrium of 9 participants on each route could continue if players assume others will likely make the same decision.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Assuming the tendency holds, both routes could again attract a near-equal number of participants.
   - A strategic decision could leverage the expectation that some players may switch routes to optimize their specific outcome; however, we might assume another distribution.
   - Picking a different route than the one taken last round could yield an average or below-average number of participants due to balancing behavior.

Based on this analysis, it may make sense to switch routes to anticipate potentially lower congestion.

JSON Output:
```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

This choice follows the expectation that since the previous round results were balanced, switching routes might benefit from a slight potential shift in the balance due to players optimizing their costs.

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 8, 'O-B-D': 10}
Your payoff was 90

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the data from the last round, let's analyze and make a well-informed decision for this round.

1. **Review Last Round Data:**
   - Number of players on route O-A-D: 8
   - Number of players on route O-B-D: 10
   - Your payoff was 90, meaning your travel cost was 310 (400 - 90).

2. **Calculate Costs from Last Round:**
   - Since your cost was 310, you must have chosen route O-B-D last round.
   - Let's verify:
     - O-B-D cost calculation: 210 (fixed) + 10 * 10 (number of players on B-D) = 210 + 100 = 310
   - Route O-A-D cost calculation: 10 * 8 (O-A) + 210 = 80 + 210 = 290

3. **Predicting the Next Round:**
   - The cost for O-A-D last round was lower at 290 compared to O-B-D at 310.
   - It's likely that participants experiencing high costs on O-B-D might switch to O-A-D this round to minimize their travel cost.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Given the trend, more players might switch to O-A-D due to its lower cost last round.
   - It might result in higher congestion on O-A-D this round.
   - Conversely, O-B-D might see fewer players if they leave due to the previous high cost.

Based on this analysis, it might make sense to choose route O-B-D again, anticipating a reduced number of players and thus lower congestion.

JSON Output:
```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

This choice expects the shift of some players to O-A-D, potentially balancing or reducing congestion on O-B-D, thus optimizing for a potentially cheaper travel cost.

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 4, 'O-B-D': 14}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the data from the last round, let's analyze and make an informed decision for this round.

1. **Review Last Round Data:**
   - Number of players on route O-A-D: 4
   - Number of players on route O-B-D: 14
   - Your payoff was 50, meaning your travel cost was 350 (400 - 50).

2. **Calculate Costs from Last Round:**
   - Since your cost was 350, you must have chosen route O-B-D last round.
   - Verify the calculation:
     - O-B-D cost calculation: 210 (fixed) + 10 * 14 (number of players on B-D) = 210 + 140 = 350
   - Route O-A-D cost for players would have been: 10 * 4 (O-A) + 210 = 40 + 210 = 250

3. **Predicting the Next Round:**
   - The cost for O-A-D last round was significantly lower at 250 compared to O-B-D at 350.
   - It's very likely that many participants on O-B-D last round will switch to O-A-D to minimize their travel cost.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Given the high cost of O-B-D last round, many participants will likely switch to O-A-D this round.
   - This shift will likely cause O-A-D to become more congested and thus more costly.
   - Conversely, O-B-D might see fewer players if they switch due to high costs, leading to lower congestion and potentially lower cost for me.

Based on this analysis, it makes strategic sense to choose route O-B-D for this round, as it is likely to be less congested with fewer players.

JSON Output:
```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

This choice anticipates that a significant number of players will switch to O-A-D due to its lower cost last round, thus reducing congestion on O-B-D and potentially optimizing travel costs.

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 5, 'O-B-D': 13}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the data from the last round, let's analyze and make an informed decision for this round.

1. **Review Last Round Data:**
   - Number of players on route O-A-D: 5
   - Number of players on route O-B-D: 13
   - Your payoff was 60, meaning your travel cost was 340 (400 - 60).

2. **Calculate Costs from Last Round:**
   - Since your cost was 340, you must have chosen route O-B-D last round.
   - Verify the calculation:
     - O-B-D cost calculation: 210 (fixed) + 10 * 13 (number of players on B-D) = 210 + 130 = 340
   - Route O-A-D cost for players would have been: 10 * 5 (O-A) + 210 = 50 + 210 = 260

3. **Predicting the Next Round:**
   - The cost for O-A-D last round was significantly lower at 260 compared to O-B-D at 340.
   - It’s very likely that many participants on O-B-D last round will switch to O-A-D to minimize their travel cost.
   - If many participants switch to O-A-D, congestion in O-A-D will increase, and the cost will rise.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Given the trend, more players are likely to switch from O-B-D to O-A-D due to its lower cost last round.
   - This expected switch may congest route O-A-D, making it costlier this round.
   - Conversely, fewer players on O-B-D will likely reduce its congestion and cost.

Based on this analysis, it makes strategic sense to choose route O-B-D for this round. Anticipating a shift of players to O-A-D due to its lower cost last round, O-B-D should see less congestion and potentially lower costs.

JSON Output:
```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

This choice anticipates that many players will switch to O-A-D, balancing between both routes and likely reducing congestion and costs on O-B-D.

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 5, 'O-B-D': 13}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the data from the last round and the structure of the problem, let's analyze and make an informed decision for this round.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Review Last Round Data:**
   - **Number of players on route O-A-D:** 5
   - **Number of players on route O-B-D:** 13
   - **Your payoff last round:** 60, which means your travel cost was 340 (400 - 60)

2. **Calculate Costs from Last Round:**
   - **O-B-D cost calculation:** 
     - Fixed cost: 210
     - Variable cost: 10 * 13 = 130
     - Total cost: 210 + 130 = 340 (You chose O-B-D)

   - **O-A-D cost calculation:**
     - Fixed cost: 210
     - Variable cost: 10 * 5 = 50
     - Total cost: 210 + 50 = 260

3. **Predicting the Next Round:**
   - Players on route O-B-D last round (13) faced a high cost of 340.
   - Players on route O-A-D last round (5) faced a lower cost of 260.
   - It's likely participants who experienced high costs on O-B-D will switch to O-A-D.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Considering many participants may switch to O-A-D due to lower costs last round, O-A-D is expected to be more congested.
   - Conversely, fewer participants might remain on O-B-D, leading to potentially lower congestion and costs for that route.

Based on this trend and analysis, it makes strategic sense to choose route O-B-D for this round, expecting lower congestion as more players might switch to O-A-D.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

This choice anticipates a shift of players away from O-B-D to O-A-D, balancing route usage and potentially lowering congestion and travel costs on O-B-D.

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 5, 'O-B-D': 13}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the repeated data from the last round, let's re-evaluate and make a well-informed decision for this round.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Review Last Round Data:**
   - **Number of players on route O-A-D:** 5
   - **Number of players on route O-B-D:** 13
   - **Your payoff last round:** 60, meaning your travel cost was 340 (400 - 60)

2. **Calculate Costs from Last Round:**
   - **O-B-D cost calculation:**
     - Fixed cost: 210
     - Variable cost: 10 * 13 = 130
     - Total cost: 210 + 130 = 340 (You chose O-B-D)
   
   - **O-A-D cost calculation:**
     - Fixed cost: 210
     - Variable cost: 10 * 5 = 50
     - Total cost: 210 + 50 = 260

3. **Predicting the Next Round:**
   - Players on route O-B-D last round (13) faced a high cost.
   - Players on route O-A-D last round (5) faced a significantly lower cost.
   - It's reasonable to assume that participants who experienced high costs on O-B-D last round will likely switch to O-A-D in order to reduce their travel costs.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Given the high number of players on O-B-D last round and its high cost, the trend suggests many will switch to O-A-D.
   - To anticipate these shifts and minimize congestion and costs, it may now be beneficial to choose O-A-D, as likely fewer players will remain on O-B-D and switch to O-A-D instead.

Based on this analysis and anticipating participant behavior, it appears that O-A-D will be more balanced or less congested if a significant number of players switch from O-B-D to O-A-D.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

This choice strategically anticipates the likely shift of players from O-B-D to O-A-D, aiming to take advantage of likely lower congestion and travel costs on O-A-D for this round.
