System: 
You're Sarah Miller, a 33-year-old data scientist.
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 20 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O A B D
Edges and associated costs:
Edge O to A, cost function: 10 * X
Edge O to B, cost function: 210
Edge A to D, cost function: 210
Edge B to D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-A-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-A to travel from O to A plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment A-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-B-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment B-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-A and B-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments A-D and O-B is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point S at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-A-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-B-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 X 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-B-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-A-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 X 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 20 rounds have exactly the same structure.


Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Here is a well-formatted JSON instance that conforms to the provided schema:

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 17, 'O-B-D': 1}
Your cost was 380

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Based on the information from the previous round where 17 players chose 'O-A-D' and 1 player chose 'O-B-D', your cost was 380. This indicates a high number of participants took the 'O-A-D' route, significantly increasing the cost for that route.

In order to make a better decision for this round, it might be reasonable to choose the less congested route, 'O-B-D', in hopes that it will have a lower cost.

Here is the well-formatted JSON instance conforming to the provided schema:

```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 1, 'O-B-D': 17}
Your cost was 380

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given that last round 1 player chose 'O-A-D' and 17 players chose 'O-B-D', resulting in a high cost for 'O-B-D', it may be more strategic to choose the less congested 'O-A-D' route.

Here is the well-formatted JSON instance conforming to the provided schema:

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 18, 'O-B-D': 0}
Your cost was 390

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Since last round all 18 participants chose the 'O-A-D' route, leading to a high cost of 390 for that route, it seems prudent to choose the less congested 'O-B-D' route this round.

Here is the well-formatted JSON instance conforming to the provided schema:

AI: Given that last round only 1 player chose 'O-A-D' and 17 players chose 'O-B-D', leading to a high cost for the 'O-B-D' route, it is likely a better strategy to choose the less congested route 'O-A-D' for this round.
