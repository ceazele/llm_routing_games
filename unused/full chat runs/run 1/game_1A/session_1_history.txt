System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To decide which route to choose, let's analyze the two options and determine a strategy:

1. **Understand the Cost Functions:**
   - Route 'O-L-D' cost: \(10X + 210\)
   - Route 'O-R-D' cost: \(210 + 10Y\)

   Here, \(X\) is the number of drivers choosing 'O-L-D' and \(Y\) is the number of drivers choosing 'O-R-D'.

2. **Initial Observation:**
   - When choosing 'O-L-D', the cost primarily depends on how many other participants choose the same route. If few drivers choose this route, the cost remains low.
   - Similarly, selecting 'O-R-D' incurs a fixed cost of 210 for 'O-R', with the additional variable cost depending on how many choose 'R-D'.

3. **Game Theory Consideration:**
   - If everyone acts rationally and aims to minimize their travel costs, ideally participants would want to distribute themselves evenly across the two routes to achieve a minimum cost balance.
   - Each round is independent, and previous round outcomes only inform, not dictate, the current round’s choice.

4. **Strategic Choice:**
   - Start by assuming a balanced distribution (9 drivers each). Compute the expected costs:
     - 'O-L-D': Cost = \(10 \times 9 + 210 = 300\)
     - 'O-R-D': Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 9 = 300\)
   - Given both are equal at this balance, the real decision involves whether you think more participants will switch from one route to another.

5. **Adaptive Strategy:**
   - If you notice more drivers prefer a particular route in the initial rounds, switch to the less preferred route as it might lower your variable cost component.

6. **Decision for this Round:**
   - In the absence of information about others' preferences, initially choosing 'O-R-D' might hold some benefit as it naturally incurs a fixed high cost that could deter overloading compared to 'O-L-D'.

Conclusion:

Based on the step-by-step analysis, and assuming an absence of information on others' decisions initially, I will choose the 'O-R-D' route for this round, hoping it's less crowded due to deterrence by the fixed cost component.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 7, 'O-R-D': 11}
Your payoff was 80

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the information from the last round, let's re-evaluate the choice of routes:

1. **Review Last Round Outcome:**
   - 'O-L-D' had 7 drivers: Cost = \(10 \times 7 + 210 = 280\)
   - 'O-R-D' had 11 drivers: Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 11 = 320\)
   - My payoff was 80, indicating I chose 'O-R-D'.

2. **Analysis of Last Round Choices:**
   - With 11 drivers on 'O-R-D', the variable cost component outweighed the fixed component, leading to higher costs.
   - 'O-L-D' was less crowded, leading to a cheaper cost of 280 for those drivers, providing them with a higher payoff of 120 (given their endowment was 400).

3. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Anticipating others might observe the same and switch to 'O-L-D' to reduce costs.
   - However, there may still be a significant number who might continue with 'O-R-D' due to inertia or hoping it balances out.

4. **Predict and Adapt:**
   - Given the higher cost on 'O-R-D', it’s reasonable to predict some drivers will migrate to 'O-L-D'.
   - However, not all 11 are expected to switch, potentially making 'O-L-D' slightly more crowded but still cost-effective in comparison.

5. **Decision for This Round:**
   - Opting for 'O-L-D' seems reasonable if I predict more drivers will continue on 'O-R-D' and some will switch but not disproportionally overload 'O-L-D'.
   - This should balance costs and ideally lead to a better payoff than the previous round.

Conclusion:

Considering the last round results and anticipated adjustments from other players, switching to 'O-L-D' could yield a better payoff.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 14, 'O-R-D': 4}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To adjust my strategy for this round, let's analyze the results and draw some insights:

1. **Review Last Round Outcome:**
   - 'O-L-D' had 14 drivers: Cost = \(10 \times 14 + 210 = 350\)
   - 'O-R-D' had 4 drivers: Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 4 = 250\)
   - My payoff was 50, which indicates I chose 'O-L-D'.

2. **Analysis of Last Round Choices:**
   - With 14 drivers on 'O-L-D', the cost became significantly high, resulting in a lower payoff.
   - 'O-R-D' with only 4 drivers had a considerably lower cost, allowing for a higher payoff for those who chose it.

3. **Strategic Insight:**
   - It appears there was an overcorrection where too many players switched to 'O-L-D', leading to a high cost on that route.
   - The cost structure and experience suggest that players may now switch back to 'O-R-D' upon observing the high cost on 'O-L-D'.

4. **Predictive Strategy for Current Round:**
   - Given that 'O-L-D' was heavily loaded last round, I anticipate that a significant number of players will switch back to 'O-R-D'.
   - It’s expected that the number of players will redistribute more evenly, or possibly tip towards more players on 'O-R-D'.

5. **Decision for This Round:**
   - Given the analysis, switching to 'O-R-D' should present a more cost-effective choice as it was less crowded in the previous round.
   - This strategy adjusts for the expected shift in player choices and aims to benefit from the likely lower cost on 'O-R-D' this round.

Conclusion:

Based on recent trends and the expectation of redistribution of players, switching to 'O-R-D' could maximize my payoff.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 4, 'O-R-D': 14}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To refine my strategy for this round, let's analyze the pattern and last round's results more thoroughly:

1. **Review Last Round Outcome:**
   - 'O-L-D' had 4 drivers: Cost = \(10 \times 4 + 210 = 250\)
   - 'O-R-D' had 14 drivers: Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 14 = 350\)
   - My payoff was 50, indicating I chose 'O-R-D'.

2. **Patterns and Insights:**
   - The overswitch to 'O-R-D' resulted in a higher cost there.
   - 'O-L-D' was significantly less crowded and hence more cost-effective for those who chose it.
   - This suggests a repeating pattern where participants react heavily to prior results, often leading to large swings in route choice.

3. **Anticipate Behavior:**
   - Many players will likely observe the high cost on 'O-R-D' and may switch back to 'O-L-D', much like the observed swings in previous rounds.
   - Given the pattern, it’s reasonable to anticipate that 'O-L-D' will be more populated this round compared to last.

4. **Strategic Decision:**
   - Opt for 'O-L-D' this round as it was comparatively less crowded in the previous round.
   - Expect a balancing effect, but still, a likely better payoff than overcrowding on 'O-R-D' might bring.

5. **Risk Consideration:**
   - The decision hinges on the expectation that enough players will adjust their choices away from 'O-R-D', providing a more balanced cost structure.

Conclusion:

Given the historical pattern and expected player behavior, choosing 'O-L-D' should ideally present a favorable outcome for this round.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a strategic decision for this round, let's analyze what has been occurring and adjust accordingly:

1. **Review Last Round Outcome:**
   - 'O-L-D' had 15 drivers: Cost = \(10 \times 15 + 210 = 360\)
   - 'O-R-D' had 3 drivers: Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 3 = 240\)
   - My payoff was 40, indicating I chose 'O-L-D'.

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - A significant number of players switched to 'O-L-D', making it overcrowded and resulting in high costs.
   - 'O-R-D' was significantly less crowded, with only 3 drivers, and thus, it had a much lower cost.

3. **Anticipate Changes:**
   - Expect that players observing the last round’s high cost on 'O-L-D' will likely switch to 'O-R-D' to avoid high costs.
   - Predict that 'O-R-D' will become more crowded, but might still be cost-effective since there’s often overreaction to cost changes.

4. **Strategic Choice:**
   - Opt for 'O-R-D' this round; it was significantly less crowded and much cheaper last round.
   - Anticipate that while some players will switch, it may still result in a balanced or preferable outcome compared to 'O-L-D'.

5. **Risk Assessment:**
   - This decision leans on the projected shifts in player behaviors towards achieving cost balance, taking advantage of strategic shifts and avoiding overcrowding.

Conclusion:

Given the high cost on 'O-L-D' and fewer players on 'O-R-D’ last round, it's strategic to switch to 'O-R-D'.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the information from last round and make a strategic decision for the upcoming round:

1. **Review Last Round Outcome:**
   - 'O-L-D' had 3 drivers: Cost = \(10 \times 3 + 210 = 240\)
   - 'O-R-D' had 15 drivers: Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 15 = 360\)
   - My payoff was 40, indicating I chose 'O-R-D', which was heavily crowded.

2. **Identify Pattern:**
   - There seems to be a strong oscillation in player choices, often leading to overcorrection.
   - 'O-L-D' was significantly less crowded last round, resulting in lower costs.

3. **Predict Player Behavior:**
   - It's likely that players will respond to last round’s high cost on 'O-R-D' by switching back to 'O-L-D'.
   - Anticipating this swing, we might still see relatively balanced numbers, but the expected behavior suggests enough players will move back to 'O-L-D'.

4. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - Choose 'O-L-D' this time, as it was less crowded in the last round and should offer a lower cost.
   - This decision leverages the expectation that those observing the low cost on 'O-L-D' will also opt for it, although possibly somewhat evenly distributed.

5. **Rationale:**
   - In past rounds, the reactive shifts in player decisions have led to one route being significantly less crowded than the other — strategically choosing the previously underutilized route can capitalize on these shifts.

Conclusion:

Considering the current trend and anticipated player behavior, the decision is to choose 'O-L-D' for a potentially better payoff.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To strategize effectively for this round, let's reflect on the previous patterns and make an informed choice:

1. **Review Last Round Outcome:**
   - 'O-L-D' had 15 drivers: Cost = \(10 \times 15 + 210 = 360\)
   - 'O-R-D' had 3 drivers: Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 3 = 240\)
   - My payoff was 40, indicating I chose 'O-L-D', which was very crowded.

2. **Pattern Observation:**
   - We observe a consistent tendency for drivers to overcorrect based on previous costs.
   - 'O-R-D' was much less crowded and thus more cost-effective last round.

3. **Predictive Behavior Analysis:**
   - Given that 'O-L-D' was heavily crowded and expensive last round, it's likely that many players will now switch to 'O-R-D'.
   - The trend suggests a strong likelihood of players oscillating back to the less crowded option.

4. **Strategic Decision for This Round:**
   - Opt for 'O-R-D', as historical behavior indicates it will likely be less crowded with many players switching.
   - This choice exploits the predictable shift and aims to benefit from lower expected congestion on 'O-R-D'.

5. **Rationale Behind Decision:**
   - The consistent overreaction and switch in player choices after a costly round have made one route consistently cheaper.
   - By choosing the less crowded option from the previous round, the goal is to achieve a higher payoff.

Conclusion:

In light of the consistent behavior pattern and the previous high cost on 'O-L-D', selecting 'O-R-D' should maximize my chances of a better payoff.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To determine the best choice for this round, let's systematically consider the observed patterns and anticipated behaviors:

1. **Review Last Round Outcome:**
   - 'O-L-D' had 3 drivers: Cost = \(10 \times 3 + 210 = 240\)
   - 'O-R-D' had 15 drivers: Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 15 = 360\)
   - My payoff was 40, indicating I chose 'O-R-D', which was the more crowded and costly option.

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - We see a clear oscillation pattern where players tend to switch routes based on previous round costs, leading to overcorrection.
   - 'O-L-D' consistently becomes the less crowded, more cost-effective route after a round where 'O-R-D' was overpopulated.

3. **Predictive Analysis:**
   - Expect many players to observe the high cost on 'O-R-D' and switch to 'O-L-D', seeking lower costs.
   - Anticipate that 'O-R-D' may become less crowded as a result, potentially balancing out the costs more evenly compared to previous rounds.

4. **Strategic Decision for This Round:**
   - Opt for 'O-L-D', leveraging the trend that has historically made this route less crowded following a costly round on 'O-R-D'.
   - This choice is based on the expectation that not all players will switch simultaneously, allowing for a balanced number of drivers on both routes.

5. **Decision Rationale:**
   - Choosing 'O-L-D' exploits the pattern-driven behavior where a previously more costly and crowded route becomes less chosen, hence cheaper.
   - Staying aware of overcorrection helps anticipate the distribution of drivers and potential costs more accurately.

Conclusion:

Given the persistent pattern of player behavior and the outcome of last round, choosing 'O-L-D' seems strategic for potentially achieving a better payoff.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the results and patterns observed, let's carefully consider the factors affecting the next choice:

1. **Review Last Round Outcome:**
   - 'O-L-D' had 16 drivers: Cost = \(10 \times 16 + 210 = 370\)
   - 'O-R-D' had 2 drivers: Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 230\)
   - My payoff was 30, indicating that I chose 'O-L-D', which ended up being very crowded.

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - There's a clear pattern of overreaction where after a high-cost round on one route, many players switch to the other route, causing overloading.
   - 'O-R-D' was significantly less crowded last round, thus more cost-effective.

3. **Behavioral Prediction:**
   - Anticipate that a large number of players will switch from 'O-L-D' to 'O-R-D' since 'O-R-D' was less crowded, seeking to lower their costs.
   - Predict that the number of drivers will likely become more balanced, but still potentially resulting in 'O-R-D' having fewer players than 'O-L-D'.

4. **Strategic Decision for This Round:**
   - Choose 'O-R-D', as it was less populated last round and has a higher chance of being less crowded compared to 'O-L-D'.
   - The choice is based on leveraging these oscillations in player behavior, aiming to benefit from predictable reactions.

5. **Rationale:**
   - The decision exploits the tendency for players to react to previous high costs by switching, thus potentially making 'O-R-D' cheaper as others redistribute themselves.

Conclusion:

Considering the consistent swing in player choices and my understanding of the cost dynamics, selecting 'O-R-D' could maximize my payoff this round.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 1, 'O-R-D': 17}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's take a strategic approach to choose the best route for the upcoming round, given the previous trends:

1. **Review Last Round Outcome:**
   - 'O-L-D' had 1 driver: Cost = \(10 \times 1 + 210 = 220\)
   - 'O-R-D' had 17 drivers: Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 17 = 380\)
   - My payoff was 20, indicating that I chose 'O-R-D', which ended up being extremely crowded.

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - There's a noticeable and reinforced pattern of drastic overreaction, with many players shifting to the less populated route after experiencing high costs, causing erratic swings in route choice concentrations.
   - 'O-L-D' was barely used last round, making it significantly cheaper.

3. **Behavioral Prediction:**
   - Given the extremely high cost for 'O-R-D' last round, a large number of players will likely switch to 'O-L-D'.
   - This might create a more balanced distribution if players are seeking to avoid the high penalty.

4. **Strategic Decision for This Round:**
   - Opt for 'O-L-D' as it has been significantly less crowded and cheaper, and it's expected that not all players will switch at once.
   - This choice is based on the knowledge that previous high concentrations tend to discourage players, potentially keeping 'O-L-D' relatively less populated.

5. **Rationale:**
   - By choosing the previously underutilized route, I aim to strategically place myself in a potentially less crowded and thus lower-cost route.

Conclusion:

Given the clear pattern of overreaction and the hefty cost difference from last round, selecting 'O-L-D' should provide a better chance for a favorable payoff this round.

```json

```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 17, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision for this round, let's systematically analyze the consistent patterns and behaviors observed:

1. **Review Last Round Outcome:**
   - 'O-L-D' had 17 drivers: Cost = \(10 \times 17 + 210 = 380\)
   - 'O-R-D' had 1 driver: Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 1 = 220\)
   - My payoff was 20, indicating that I chose 'O-L-D', which was heavily crowded.

2. **Identify Pattern:**
   - There is a continued strong oscillation of route choices, where players heavily switch when a route becomes costly, leading to the opposing route being less crowded.
   - With 17 players on 'O-L-D', the cost was significantly higher than 'O-R-D' which was hardly used.

3. **Predictive Behavior:**
   - Given 'O-L-D' was highly crowded, it is reasonable to expect many players will switch to 'O-R-D' to avoid costs.
   - 'O-R-D' is anticipated to have more players, but given historical overreactions, it might not reach heavy overcrowding immediately.

4. **Strategic Decision for This Round:**
   - Opt for 'O-R-D', as it was very lightly used, and is expected to remain a feasible option even as players switch from 'O-L-D'.
   - Based on patterns, choosing the less populated previous route typically yields a lower-cost situation.

5. **Rationale:**
   - This choice is leveraging the pattern of drastic switching, aiming to avoid the heavily crowded route and benefit from the cost-efficient choice.

Conclusion:

Considering historical oscillations and aiming for a cost-effective journey, choosing 'O-R-D' should provide a strategic benefit this round.

```json

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 1, 'O-R-D': 17}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To determine the most strategic route for the next round, let's carefully analyze the pattern and outcomes:

1. **Review Last Round Outcome:**
   - 'O-L-D' had 1 driver: Cost = \(10 \times 1 + 210 = 220\)
   - 'O-R-D' had 17 drivers: Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 17 = 380\)
   - My payoff was 20, indicating that I chose 'O-R-D', which was extremely crowded and costly.

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - There is a consistent pattern of significant overreaction, where players greatly shift to one route after the other becomes costly.
   - 'O-R-D' was extremely crowded last round, driving costs up significantly compared to the mostly vacant 'O-L-D'.

3. **Predictive Behavior:**
   - It's likely that many players will observe the high cost of 'O-R-D' and switch to 'O-L-D'.
   - Anticipating another swing, 'O-L-D' may have more drivers, but possibly not to the extent of overcrowding observed previously, as players try to distribute more evenly.

4. **Strategic Decision for This Round:**
   - Choose 'O-L-D', leveraging the clear pattern of players shifting to the previously less used route, aiming for lower costs.
   - This decision banks on the fact that players try to correct for overcrowding, which consistently vacates the other route.

5. **Rationale:**
   - Choosing the route that was less populated the previous round generally reduces the risk of overcrowding and high costs, based on observed player behaviors.

Conclusion:

In light of the consistent overreaction pattern and aiming for a more cost-effective journey, selecting 'O-L-D' is strategically favorable.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To determine the best route for this round, let's analyze previous patterns and draw strategic conclusions:

1. **Review Last Round Outcome:**
   - 'O-L-D' had 15 drivers: Cost = \(10 \times 15 + 210 = 360\)
   - 'O-R-D' had 3 drivers: Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 3 = 240\)
   - My payoff was 40, indicating I chose 'O-L-D', which was heavily crowded and costly.

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - Players tend to significantly react to previous round costs, often leading to overcorrections where the majority switch to the previously less crowded route.
   - 'O-R-D' had fewer drivers last round, making it a cheaper alternative.

3. **Predictive Behavior:**
   - Given the high cost on 'O-L-D', many players are likely to switch to 'O-R-D', trying to lower their costs.
   - However, based on historical trends, a complete switch might lead to balance rather than severe overcrowding.

4. **Strategic Decision for This Round:**
   - Opt for 'O-R-D', as it was less crowded and cost-effective last round, and it's expected that players will aim for cost efficiency.
   - This choice is consistent with leveraging the observed pattern of seeking the less crowded route.

5. **Rationale:**

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To decide on the optimal route for this round, let's examine the current context and patterns:

1. **Review Last Round Outcome:**
   - 'O-L-D' had 2 drivers: Cost = \(10 \times 2 + 210 = 230\)
   - 'O-R-D' had 16 drivers: Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 16 = 370\)
   - My payoff was 30, indicating that I chose 'O-R-D', which was heavily crowded and costly.

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - A clear overreaction trend is visible, where overcompensation leads players to switch en masse to the previously less crowded route.
   - 'O-L-D' was significantly less crowded last round, making it the less costly route.

3. **Predictive Behavior:**
   - It's probable that many players will shift from 'O-R-D' to 'O-L-D' to avoid high costs.
   - Based on previous behavior, some redistribution will occur, but 'O-L-D' should remain a feasible option.

4. **Strategic Decision for This Round:**
   - Choose 'O-L-D', leveraging its previously low congestion and the likelihood that players will switch to it in response to high costs on 'O-R-D'.
   - This choice taps into the oscillating pattern and aims to enjoy lower congestion on this round.

5. **Rationale:**
   - Opting for the less congested route from the previous round typically aligns with cost-effective decision-making in light of observed player behavior.
