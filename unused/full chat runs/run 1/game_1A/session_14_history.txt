System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision, I will analyze the costs and potential strategies step-by-step.

1. **Understanding Cost Dynamics:**
   - Route 'O-L-D': Cost = \(10X + 210\)
     - The cost here depends on the number of drivers \(X\) choosing this route.
   - Route 'O-R-D': Cost = \(210 + 10Y\)
     - Similarly, the cost here depends on \(Y\), the number of drivers choosing this route.

2. **Game Setup:**
   - There are 18 drivers in total.
   - Each driver independently chooses one of the two routes.
   - The aim is to minimize travel costs effectively.

3. **Scenario Analysis:**
   - If I choose route 'O-L-D' and very few others do the same, my costs could be significantly low (closer to 220).
   - If I choose 'O-R-D' and most others pick this route too, my costs could be significantly high (closer to 390).

4. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - **Balance Strategy:** Since the routes have a coupling effect because they share drivers, an optimal strategy may be to choose the less crowded route.
   - Start by picking the route that others are less likely to choose based on previous rounds, thereby potentially minimizing costs.

5. **Adaptive Strategy:**
   - Observe trends from previous rounds to ascertain which route is becoming overcrowded.
   - Adjust accordingly to maintain a lower cost in subsequent rounds.

6. **Decision for Initial Rounds:**
   - Without prior data from other rounds (since this is round 1), I will make an educated guess based on presenting a balanced decision to start with.
   - **Assumption:** Participants might initially hedge towards 'O-R-D' because only the end segment's cost varies.
   - Therefore, I choose 'O-L-D' to potentially benefit from a lower starting cost if fewer drivers choose it initially.

Given these considerations, the chosen route for this decision will be 'O-L-D'.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 7, 'O-R-D': 11}
Your payoff was 120

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make the best decision for this round, let's analyze the situation based on the provided data:

1. **Previous Round Insights:**
   - Route allocation: 'O-L-D' had 7 drivers, 'O-R-D' had 11 drivers.
   - My payoff last round was 120, which suggests my cost was \(400 - 120 = 280\).
   - Since I chose 'O-L-D' and there were 7 drivers:
     - Cost = \(10 \times 7 + 210 = 280\), which aligns with my observed payoff.

2. **Understanding Cost Dynamics for This Round:**
   - If the distribution remains similar this round:
     - 'O-L-D': 7 drivers cost \(10 \times 7 + 210 = 280\).
     - 'O-R-D': 11 drivers cost \(210 + 10 \times 11 = 320\).

3. **Strategic Analysis:**
   - Choosing 'O-L-D' appears to have been a better strategy given that its cost was lower than 'O-R-D'.
   - Participants on 'O-R-D' paid more, implying higher potential costs and lower payoff.

4. **Anticipating Adjustments by Others:**
   - Given that 'O-R-D' was costlier, some drivers on 'O-R-D' might consider switching to 'O-L-D'.
   - If 1 or 2 additional drivers switch, the cost of 'O-L-D' can still be competitive:
     - For 8 drivers: Cost = \(10 \times 8 + 210 = 290\)
     - For 9 drivers: Cost = \(10 \times 9 + 210 = 300\)

5. **Decision Making:**
   - 'O-L-D' is currently a better strategy; even if a few more switch, it remains beneficial.
   - Additionally, choosing 'O-R-D' carries risk—it may not reduce enough in number to become cheaper than 'O-L-D'.

6. **Chosen Route for This Round:**
   - I will continue with 'O-L-D', anticipating it remains more cost-effective.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 14, 'O-R-D': 4}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the information from the last round, it's crucial to reassess the strategy:

1. **Previous Round Insights:**
   - Route allocation: 'O-L-D' had 14 drivers, 'O-R-D' had 4 drivers.
   - My payoff was 50, meaning my cost was \(400 - 50 = 350\).
   - Since I chose 'O-L-D' and there were 14 drivers:
     - Cost for 'O-L-D': \(10 \times 14 + 210 = 350\)
   - Cost for 'O-R-D': \(210 + 10 \times 4 = 250\)

2. **Understanding the Shift:**
   - Many drivers switched to 'O-L-D', leading to a high cost for this route.
   - 'O-R-D' was significantly less crowded, making it much cheaper.

3. **Anticipating Reactions:**
   - Drivers from 'O-L-D' who experienced high costs are likely to switch to 'O-R-D' in this round.
   - It's reasonable to expect a more even distribution or even potentially more drivers on 'O-R-D'.

4. **Cost Calculations:**
   - If the distribution shifts towards 'O-R-D':
     - For 8 drivers on 'O-R-D': Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 8 = 290\)
   - If 'O-L-D' decreases in drivers:
     - For 10 drivers on 'O-L-D': Cost = \(10 \times 10 + 210 = 310\)

5. **Strategy Adjustment:**
   - Current dynamics suggest shifting to 'O-R-D' might now be beneficial, considering it had lower costs and is likely to still have fewer drivers.
   - I will choose 'O-R-D', expecting fewer drivers overall or a more balanced distribution, leading to lower costs compared to last round.

6. **Chosen Route for This Round:**
   - Switching to 'O-R-D' to potentially leverage its lower cost, anticipating continued shifts in player decisions.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 4, 'O-R-D': 14}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the further shift in the distribution of drivers in the last round, let's reassess and decide:

1. **Previous Round Insights:**
   - Route allocation: 'O-L-D' had 4 drivers, 'O-R-D' had 14 drivers.
   - My payoff was 50, implying my cost was \(400 - 50 = 350\).
   - Since I chose 'O-R-D' with 14 drivers:
     - Cost for 'O-R-D': \(210 + 10 \times 14 = 350\)
   - Cost for 'O-L-D': \(10 \times 4 + 210 = 250\)

2. **Analysis of the Shift:**
   - Many drivers switched to 'O-R-D', reversing the previous route congestion perception.
   - 'O-L-D' became much cheaper with only 4 drivers.

3. **Anticipating Future Moves:**
   - Drivers on 'O-R-D' who experienced the high cost may now shift to 'O-L-D' seeking lower costs.
   - This cyclical behavior is typical with such a distribution, as all drivers aim to minimize costs.

4. **Strategic Adjustments:**
   - Given the significant imbalance last round, it's reasonable to expect a number of drivers to now favor 'O-L-D'.
   - There's a potential risk of too many switching, making them equivalent if 'O-L-D' gets crowded.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - With the drastic difference, 'O-L-D' presents a more attractive option as it stands.
   - The key is to anticipate that shifts toward 'O-L-D' may increase costs, but likely not as high as before.

6. **Chosen Route for This Round:**
   - I will choose 'O-L-D', expecting a few more drivers might switch, but anticipating it will still be less costly than 'O-R-D'.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the rapid shifts in route distribution, let's evaluate the situation:

1. **Previous Round Insights:**
   - Route allocation: 'O-L-D' had 15 drivers, 'O-R-D' had 3 drivers.
   - My payoff was 40, meaning my cost was \(400 - 40 = 360\).
   - Since I chose 'O-L-D' with 15 drivers:
     - Cost for 'O-L-D': \(10 \times 15 + 210 = 360\)
   - Cost for 'O-R-D': \(210 + 10 \times 3 = 240\)

2. **Understanding the Pattern:**
   - A significant shift to 'O-L-D' occurred, making it overly crowded and costly.
   - 'O-R-D' became significantly cheaper due to fewer drivers.

3. **Anticipating the Next Moves:**
   - Drivers who were on 'O-L-D' and faced high costs are likely to consider switching to 'O-R-D' this round.
   - With such a large group on 'O-L-D', it’s probable more drivers will now swing to 'O-R-D'.

4. **Strategic Analysis:**
   - Since 'O-R-D' was much cheaper last round, it’s likely to see an increase in drivers.
   - However, starting from only 3 drivers, this route has some margin to accommodate more drivers while remaining cost-effective compared to 'O-L-D'.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - Based on the rapid and cyclical shifts, attending to the less crowded route is key.
   - Expecting adjustments, choosing the previously less popular route might offer the lowest costs.

6. **Chosen Route for This Round:**
   - I will choose 'O-R-D', as it allows the best chance for minimized costs given recent patterns.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the current dynamics and previous behavior, let's reevaluate and make a decision:

1. **Previous Round Insights:**
   - Route allocation: 'O-L-D' had 3 drivers, 'O-R-D' had 15 drivers.
   - My payoff was 40, meaning my cost was \(400 - 40 = 360\).
   - Since I chose 'O-R-D' with 15 drivers:
     - Cost for 'O-R-D': \(210 + 10 \times 15 = 360\)
   - Cost for 'O-L-D': \(10 \times 3 + 210 = 240\)

2. **Understanding the Pattern:**
   - Again, a dramatic shift to 'O-R-D', making it significantly crowded and costly.
   - 'O-L-D' was much cheaper with only 3 drivers.

3. **Anticipating the Next Moves:**
   - Many drivers who experienced high costs on 'O-R-D' are likely to swing back to 'O-L-D'.
   - Given such a drastic crowd on 'O-R-D', many will aim to avoid similar costs this round.

4. **Strategic Analysis:**
   - Given the extreme swing in choices, the optimal strategy would suggest moving to the less crowded route.
   - It's anticipated that drivers will adjust their choices sharply based on the previous round's cost.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - With the knowledge that over 15 drivers chose 'O-R-D', switching to 'O-L-D' seems strategically sound as it will likely have a reduced number of drivers.
   - The goal is to leverage these oscillations to maximize payoff.

6. **Chosen Route for This Round:**
   - I will choose 'O-L-D', seeing it as the less congested and more cost-effective route this round.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the current dynamics and recent rounds' information, let's analyze and decide strategically:

1. **Previous Round Insights:**
   - Route allocation: 'O-L-D' had 15 drivers, 'O-R-D' had 3 drivers.
   - My payoff was 40, implying my cost was \(400 - 40 = 360\).
   - Since I chose 'O-L-D' with 15 drivers:
     - Cost for 'O-L-D': \(10 \times 15 + 210 = 360\)
   - Cost for 'O-R-D': \(210 + 10 \times 3 = 240\)

2. **Understanding the Pattern:**
   - There has been a large swing back and forth between 'O-L-D' and 'O-R-D'.
   - When a majority crowd one route, costs become high, prompting the majority to switch the next round.

3. **Anticipating the Next Moves:**
   - Many drivers on 'O-L-D', experiencing high costs, are likely considering switching to 'O-R-D'.
   - This suggests 'O-R-D' may now become more popular, lowering congestion on 'O-L-D'.

4. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - With fluctuating preferences, choosing the route with fewer drivers tends to minimize costs.
   - Given the pattern, 'O-L-D' is likely to have fewer drivers and thus potentially lower costs.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - Observing such shifts suggests it's likely that more drivers will switch to 'O-R-D'.
   - Choosing 'O-R-D' would risk encountering similar congestion issues as previous rounds.

6. **Chosen Route for This Round:**
   - To optimize for cost, I will choose 'O-R-D', as I anticipate fewer drivers shifting might make it cost-effective.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the repetitive patterns and congestion dynamics over recent rounds, let's carefully evaluate the current situation:

1. **Previous Round Insights:**
   - Route allocation: 'O-L-D' had 3 drivers, 'O-R-D' had 15 drivers.
   - My payoff was 40, meaning my cost was \(400 - 40 = 360\).
   - Since I chose 'O-R-D' with 15 drivers:
     - Cost for 'O-R-D': \(210 + 10 \times 15 = 360\)
   - Cost for 'O-L-D': \(10 \times 3 + 210 = 240\)

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - A clear pattern has emerged where drivers are oscillating between routes in an effort to avoid high costs.
   - Currently, when one route becomes heavily crowded, nearly everyone shifts to the opposite route the following round.

3. **Anticipating Driver Behavior:**
   - Many drivers who experienced high costs on 'O-R-D' are likely to consider switching to 'O-L-D' this round.
   - It is anticipated that 'O-L-D' will become more popular as drivers react to the previous high costs on 'O-R-D'.

4. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Given the drastic shifts previously, a rational adjustment would be towards the currently underutilized route.
   - Opting for the less crowded route is likely to lead to lower costs.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - Choosing the currently less crowded route ('O-L-D'), based on historical patterns, would be strategic since it's expected to have fewer drivers after the majority experienced congestion on 'O-R-D'.

6. **Chosen Route for This Round:**
   - I will choose 'O-L-D', anticipating that it will be less crowded and consequently more cost-effective this round.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the extreme fluctuations in route choices, let's strategize based on the latest information:

1. **Previous Round Insights:**
   - Route allocation: 'O-L-D' had 16 drivers, 'O-R-D' had 2 drivers.
   - My payoff was 30, meaning my cost was \(400 - 30 = 370\).
   - Since I chose 'O-L-D' with 16 drivers:
     - Cost for 'O-L-D': \(10 \times 16 + 210 = 370\)
   - Cost for 'O-R-D': \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 230\)

2. **Understanding the Pattern:**
   - A significant number of drivers swung to 'O-L-D', making it very crowded and costly.
   - 'O-R-D' was much less crowded and cheaper.

3. **Anticipating the Next Moves:**
   - Given the high cost on 'O-L-D', many of those drivers will likely switch to 'O-R-D' to avoid the high cost.
   - The cyclical pattern strongly indicates a probable reversal.

4. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Given these observations, moving to the currently less popular route ('O-R-D') should result in lower costs.
   - Leverage the understanding that each route becomes crowded, then abandoned in favor of the alternative.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - To minimize cost, the aim is to be on the route that currently has fewer drivers.
   - With the expected shift back to 'O-R-D', it's likely to become more crowded but starting from just 2 drivers offers some leeway.

6. **Chosen Route for This Round:**
   - I will choose 'O-R-D', anticipating reduced costs due to its current low driver count and likely influx.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 1, 'O-R-D': 17}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the information from the last round, it's crucial to adapt the strategy based on the extreme congestion on 'O-R-D':

1. **Previous Round Insights:**
   - Route allocation: 'O-L-D' had 1 driver, 'O-R-D' had 17 drivers.
   - My payoff was 20, meaning my cost was \(400 - 20 = 380\).
   - Since I chose 'O-R-D' with 17 drivers:
     - Cost for 'O-R-D': \(210 + 10 \times 17 = 380\)
   - Cost for 'O-L-D': \(10 \times 1 + 210 = 220\)

2. **Understanding the Pattern:**
   - A drastic movement to 'O-R-D' occurred, leading to very high congestion and cost.
   - 'O-L-D', with only 1 driver, resulted in significantly lower costs.

3. **Anticipating the Next Moves:**
   - Drivers who faced high costs on 'O-R-D' are very likely to switch to 'O-L-D' to reduce costs.
   - This pattern suggests an upcoming shift towards 'O-L-D'.

4. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Given the sharp variations, choosing the currently less crowded route ('O-L-D') should minimize costs.
   - The expectation is that 'O-L-D' will see more drivers, but it is starting from a very low count.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - Predictably, 'O-L-D' offers lower costs given it was heavily underutilized in the previous round.
   - Opting for 'O-L-D' given its current cost advantage and the likelihood of reduced congestion.

6. **Chosen Route for This Round:**
   - I will choose 'O-L-D', anticipating that it will remain less crowded and ultimately cheaper.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the ongoing pattern of route selection and the results of the previous round, here's how to approach this round's decision:

1. **Previous Round Insights:**
   - Route allocation: 'O-L-D' had 17 drivers, 'O-R-D' had 1 driver.
   - My payoff was 20, meaning my cost was \(400 - 20 = 380\).
   - Since I chose 'O-L-D' with 17 drivers:
     - Cost for 'O-L-D': \(10 \times 17 + 210 = 380\)
   - Cost for 'O-R-D': \(210 + 10 \times 1 = 220\)

2. **Understanding the Pattern:**
   - A substantial shift occurred towards 'O-L-D', resulting in heavy congestion and high costs.
   - 'O-R-D' had only 1 driver, making it quite cheap.

3. **Anticipating the Next Moves:**
   - Drivers who experienced high costs on 'O-L-D' are expected to switch to 'O-R-D' this round.
   - This fits the observed cyclical behavior where drivers avoid the previously congested route.

4. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Favor switching to the currently less crowded route ('O-R-D'), which statistically should offer lower costs.
   - The expectation is that 'O-R-D' will gather more drivers, but starting from only one driver provides a favorable baseline.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - By moving to the less congested route, I aim to benefit from lower travel costs.
   - Given the history, one should tactically choose the less crowded route where costs were previously lower.

6. **Chosen Route for This Round:**
   - I will choose 'O-R-D', which historically should provide a cost advantage due to reduced congestion.

```json

AI: Based on the observed pattern and the most recent results, let's consider the decision for this round:

1. **Previous Round Insights:**
   - Route allocation: 'O-L-D' had 1 driver, 'O-R-D' had 17 drivers.
   - My payoff was 20, meaning my cost was \(400 - 20 = 380\).
   - Since I chose 'O-R-D' with 17 drivers:
     - Cost for 'O-R-D': \(210 + 10 \times 17 = 380\)
   - Cost for 'O-L-D': \(10 \times 1 + 210 = 220\)

2. **Understanding the Pattern:**
   - The majority swung drastically back to 'O-R-D', leading to heavy congestion and high costs.
   - 'O-L-D', with just 1 driver, resulted in much lower costs.

3. **Anticipating Next Moves:**
   - Many drivers who experienced high costs on 'O-R-D' are expected to switch to 'O-L-D' this round.
   - This aligns with the cycle observed, where drivers repeatedly shift away from the more congested route.

4. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Given this consistent back-and-forth behavior, moving to the currently less crowded route ('O-L-D') is optimal.
   - The aim is to capitalize on the decreased congestion costs of the less populated route.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - By selecting the least crowded route from the last round, the goal is to benefit from lower costs.
   - Historically, choosing the route that had fewer drivers in the previous round reduces the likelihood of high costs.

6. **Chosen Route for This Round:**
   - I will choose 'O-L-D', expecting it to remain less crowded and offer a lower cost due to the anticipated switches.

AI: Given the ongoing fluctuations and the current dynamics from the last round, let's proceed with a detailed analysis:

1. **Previous Round Insights:**
   - Route allocation: 'O-L-D' had 15 drivers, 'O-R-D' had 3 drivers.
   - My payoff was 40, indicating my cost was \(400 - 40 = 360\).
   - Since I chose 'O-L-D' with 15 drivers:
     - Cost for 'O-L-D': \(10 \times 15 + 210 = 360\)
   - Cost for 'O-R-D': \(210 + 10 \times 3 = 240\)

2. **Understanding the Pattern:**
   - 'O-L-D' became heavily congested again, leading to high costs.
   - 'O-R-D' was much less crowded, therefore significantly cheaper.

3. **Anticipating Next Moves:**
   - Drivers who encountered high costs on 'O-L-D' are likely to shift to 'O-R-D' in this round.
   - This cyclical movement suggests many will opt to reduce costs by switching routes.

4. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Given these observations, choosing the less congested route ('O-R-D') should help minimize costs.
   - This route, starting with a low driver count, offers a substantial margin for cost-effectiveness.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - With high costs from previous rounds in mind, choosing the route less driven offers a solid opportunity for reduced expenditure.
   - The strategy is to move towards 'O-R-D' this round, expecting a lower number of drivers to result in minimized costs.

6. **Chosen Route for This Round:**
   - I will choose 'O-R-D', anticipating a reduction in congestion and a lower travel cost.

Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the observations from previous rounds and current data, I will make a calculated decision:

1. **Previous Round Insights:**
   - Route allocation: 'O-L-D' had 2 drivers, 'O-R-D' had 16 drivers.
   - My payoff was 30, meaning my cost was \(400 - 30 = 370\).
   - Since I chose 'O-R-D' with 16 drivers:
     - Cost for 'O-R-D': \(210 + 10 \times 16 = 370\)
   - Cost for 'O-L-D': \(10 \times 2 + 210 = 230\)

2. **Understanding the Pattern:**
   - The majority of drivers were on 'O-R-D', leading to high costs and congestion.
   - 'O-L-D' was far less crowded, resulting in significantly lower costs.

3. **Anticipating Next Moves:**
   - Given the high cost on 'O-R-D', many drivers are likely to consider switching to 'O-L-D' to reduce their costs.
   - It's typical in this game for drivers to oscillate to the less congested route after experiencing high costs.

4. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Historically, selecting the less congested route appears to offer the best opportunity to minimize costs.
   - With very few drivers on 'O-L-D' last round, it presents itself as the more cost-effective option this time.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - To capitalize on these dynamics, the strategy is to choose 'O-L-D' this round, expecting less congestion and lower costs.

6. **Chosen Route for This Round:**
   - I will choose 'O-L-D', anticipating reduced costs due to a switch from the previously congested 'O-R-D'.

   - Cost for 'O-R-D': \(210 + 10 \times 3 = 240\)

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - A significant majority moved back to 'O-L-D', causing high congestion and costs.
   - 'O-R-D' remained much less crowded and therefore cheaper in terms of cost.

3. **Anticipating Player Behavior:**
   - Players who faced high costs on 'O-L-D' are likely considering a switch to 'O-R-D' to optimize their costs this round.
   - This oscillation is a common behavior pattern in an attempt to evade high congestion costs.

4. **Strategic Approach:**
   - Opting for the route with fewer drivers, currently 'O-R-D', should potentially reduce my costs.
   - With knowledge that many will move away after high costs, 'O-R-D' stands to be more cost-efficient given its lower congestion.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - Aiming for the route that's less crowded in the previous round is usually a beneficial strategy for cost minimization.

6. **Chosen Route for This Round:**
   - I will choose 'O-R-D', expecting fewer drivers this time around and consequently a lower cost.
