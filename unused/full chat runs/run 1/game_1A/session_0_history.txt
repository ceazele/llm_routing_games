System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision about which route to choose, we need to consider the costs associated with both routes and aim to minimize our travel cost to maximize our payoff. Here are the step-by-step considerations:

1. **Understanding the Cost Functions**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: Cost = 10 * X + 210
     - X is the number of drivers choosing O-L-D.
   - **Route O-R-D**: Cost = 210 + 10 * Y
     - Y is the number of drivers choosing O-R-D.

2. **Endowment and Payoff**:
   - Each round starts with an endowment of 400 points.
   - The goal is to maximize payoff, which is calculated as:
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost

3. **Route Decision Factors**:
   - If more drivers choose O-L-D, the cost on segment O-L increases, making O-R-D potentially more attractive.
   - Conversely, if more drivers choose O-R-D, the cost on segment R-D increases, making O-L-D potentially more attractive.

4. **Initial Hypothesis**:
   - Since the network and decision are symmetrical in terms of cost function setup, initially, we might assume both routes to have an equal chance of being chosen by others.

5. **Strategic Consideration**:
   - In initial rounds, without prior information on other drivers' behavior, a balanced initial choice or switching strategy might be reasonable to gather information.
   - Over rounds, observe if there is a trend or pattern in the number of drivers choosing each route to adjust decisions accordingly.
   - A strategy could be to choose the route that seemed less preferred in the last few rounds to minimize congestion and reduce travel cost.

6. **Equal Starting Point**:
   - For the first choice, given the symmetry and lack of initial data, choose any route as a starting point. In this strategy, we will pick one and then adjust based on future rounds' outcomes.

7. **Decision**:
   - For this round, choose 'O-R-D' as the initial choice. This choice is arbitrary for the first round and will be assessed against outcomes for future adjustments.

Given this analysis, here's the decision:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 7, 'O-R-D': 11}
Your payoff was 80

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the situation from the last round and consider the steps for making the next decision:

1. **Review of Last Round**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 7 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-L-D = 10 * 7 + 210 = 280.
   - **Route O-R-D**: 11 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-R-D = 210 + 10 * 11 = 320.
   - Your payoff was 80.
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost
     - So, Travel Cost = 400 - 80 = 320, confirming you chose route O-R-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-R-D was more crowded, leading to a higher travel cost of 320.
   - Route O-L-D had fewer drivers, with a lower cost of 280.
   - Choosing a less popular route tends to minimize travel costs, increasing payoffs.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - Given more drivers went on O-R-D last round, there's potential for O-L-D to be less expensive if the distribution remains similar.
   - Anticipate if other players might recognize the same pattern and switch routes, potentially balancing player distribution or shifting congestion.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - By shifting to the less crowded route based on prior round results, the objective is to reduce the cost and improve the payoff.
   - Given the last round's results, it seems advantageous to select route O-L-D for this round.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Choose route O-L-D to minimize anticipated congestion and lower potential travel costs.

Based on this analysis, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 14, 'O-R-D': 4}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's evaluate the situation from the last round and use it to inform our decision:

1. **Review of Last Round**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 14 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-L-D = 10 * 14 + 210 = 350.
   - **Route O-R-D**: 4 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-R-D = 210 + 10 * 4 = 250.
   - Your payoff was 50.
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost
     - So, Travel Cost = 400 - 50 = 350, confirming you chose route O-L-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-L-D became much more crowded, leading to a higher travel cost of 350.
   - Route O-R-D was less crowded, resulting in a lower cost of 250.
   - More participants moved to route O-L-D, which increased the costs significantly.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - The significant shift to O-L-D suggests that many participants reacted similarly, possibly due to prior cost insights.
   - Being proactive about recognizing potential shifts can help select a less congested route.
   - It's likely that other drivers might now realize O-R-D was less crowded last round and switch, but some might remain due to inertia or misreaction.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - Given Route O-L-D's high number last round, Route O-R-D is likely to have fewer players this round if players gradually balance out again.
   - The goal is to switch to a less congested route and capitalize on lower travel cost.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the last round's heavy congestion in O-L-D, choosing route O-R-D should present a lower travel cost opportunity.

Taking into account these insights, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 4, 'O-R-D': 14}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze last round's results and formulate a strategy for this round:

1. **Review of Last Round**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 4 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-L-D = 10 * 4 + 210 = 250.
   - **Route O-R-D**: 14 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-R-D = 210 + 10 * 14 = 350.
   - Your payoff was 50.
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost
     - Therefore, Travel Cost = 400 - 50 = 350, confirming you chose route O-R-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-R-D became much more crowded, leading to a high travel cost of 350.
   - Route O-L-D had fewer drivers, preserving a lower cost of 250.
   - More participants switched back to route O-R-D, which made O-L-D the more economical option last round.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - With a significant congestion on O-R-D, participants experienced high costs, likely prompting them to switch in the next round.
   - It's expected that some drivers will shift to O-L-D based on last round's congestion. However, the magnitude of shift is uncertain.
   - Choosing the less crowded route from the last round (O-L-D) is a strategic move to potentially experience lower costs.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - Based on last round’s congestion on O-R-D, switching to O-L-D seems a prudent choice under normal circumstances if assuming others will also respond to cost differentials similarly.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Aim to choose route O-L-D to minimize anticipated congestion and travel costs, given the significant crowd on O-R-D in the previous round.

Based on this reasoning, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's evaluate the previous round's outcome and use it to inform the decision for this round:

1. **Review of Last Round**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 15 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-L-D = 10 * 15 + 210 = 360.
   - **Route O-R-D**: 3 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-R-D = 210 + 10 * 3 = 240.
   - Your payoff was 40.
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost
     - Therefore, Travel Cost = 400 - 40 = 360, confirming you chose route O-L-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-L-D was heavily congested, leading to increased travel costs of 360.
   - Route O-R-D had very few drivers, resulting in a much lower cost of 240.
   - More participants seemed to anticipate Route O-R-D would become congested again, vastly shifting the balance to O-L-D, making it more costly.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - With such high congestion on O-L-D, many drivers will likely reconsider their choice and may switch back to O-R-D.
   - The flip-flop nature seen in route selection so far suggests playing against the grain could result in a better outcome.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - Given the high number of drivers on O-L-D and the significantly lower cost of O-R-D, it would be strategic to choose the less crowded O-R-D.
   - Anticipate the likelihood of drivers reacting to last round's congestion and adjust accordingly to capitalize on lower predicted costs.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Opting for route O-R-D is expected to minimize travel cost due to the assumed shift of drivers from O-L-D to O-R-D after last round's high congestion on O-L-D.

In light of these considerations, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Based on the outcomes and patterns from the previous rounds, let's consider our decision for this round.

1. **Review of Last Round**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 3 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-L-D = 10 * 3 + 210 = 240.
   - **Route O-R-D**: 15 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-R-D = 210 + 10 * 15 = 360.
   - Your payoff was 40.
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost
     - Therefore, Travel Cost = 400 - 40 = 360, confirming you chose route O-R-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-R-D was heavily congested with 15 drivers, resulting in a high cost of 360.
   - Route O-L-D had significantly fewer drivers, leading to a lower cost of 240.
   - This indicates players significantly shifted to O-R-D, causing substantial congestion and higher costs.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - Given the heavy congestion on O-R-D, it’s reasonable to expect that many drivers will react by switching to O-L-D in the current round.
   - Observing the oscillating pattern where drivers switch en masse between rounds to the less used route suggests a new shift is likely.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - Anticipate a shift from O-R-D to O-L-D by other participants as they seek to avoid the projected high costs on O-R-D.
   - Opting for the historically less crowded route might offer a strategic advantage, minimizing travel costs.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Selecting route O-L-D is expected to present a lower cost opportunity due to last round’s congestion on O-R-D, where many drivers will likely reconsider and shift accordingly.

Thus, applying these considerations, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

   - Your payoff was 40.
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost
     - Therefore, Travel Cost = 400 - 40 = 360, confirming you chose route O-L-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-L-D was heavily congested, leading to a high travel cost of 360.
   - Route O-R-D had very few drivers, resulting in a much lower cost of 240.
   - This indicates a significant shift in drivers moving to O-L-D, likely anticipating an O-R-D congestion that did not materialize.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - Given the high congestion on O-L-D, it's reasonable to anticipate that many drivers will react by switching to O-R-D in the current round.
   - The variance in route choice suggests participants are actively responding to previous rounds' feedback, indicating a tendency to overcompensate by moving en masse to the other route.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - Anticipate a shift from O-L-D to O-R-D by other participants as they seek to avoid the high costs seen on O-L-D.
   - Choosing the least crowded route from the previous round (O-R-D) would likely minimize travel costs.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Opting for route O-R-D should present a lower cost opportunity as many drivers may shift from O-L-D due to last round's high congestion.

Using these insights, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

   - Your payoff was 40.
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost
     - Therefore, Travel Cost = 400 - 40 = 360, confirming you chose route O-R-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-R-D was congested, resulting in a high cost of 360.
   - Route O-L-D had fewer drivers, leading to a lower cost of 240.
   - A notable pattern is emerging where players tend to shift significantly between the two routes, indicating a reactionary pattern.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - Given the congestion on O-R-D, it’s likely that many drivers will switch to O-L-D to avoid the high costs experienced on O-R-D last round.
   - Observing this pattern, there's a typical behavioral shift where participants tend to overcorrect by switching en masse to the other route.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - Expecting many drivers to react to last round's high congestion by moving from O-R-D to O-L-D.
   - To capitalize on this potential shift, moving to O-R-D could present a cost advantage this round.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Opting for O-R-D is logical, assuming other drivers shift their choice based on previous costs, as the current pattern suggests.

Based on this analysis, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

     - Cost for O-L-D = 10 * 16 + 210 = 370.
   - **Route O-R-D**: 2 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-R-D = 210 + 10 * 2 = 230.
   - Your payoff was 170.
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost
     - Therefore, Travel Cost = 400 - 170 = 230, confirming you chose route O-R-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-L-D became extremely congested, leading to a very high cost of 370.
   - Route O-R-D had significantly fewer drivers, resulting in a much lower cost of 230.
   - Players moved heavily to O-L-D, underestimating the potential shift and resulting in high congestion.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - With such heavy congestion on O-L-D, many drivers will likely switch to O-R-D to avoid the high costs experienced on O-L-D.
   - Considering the pattern, participants seem to overcommit to the less used route from the previous round.
   - There's a tendency for major shifts, and understanding this pattern can allow for strategic positioning.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - It's probable that several drivers will switch away from O-L-D to O-R-D based on last round’s costs.
   - The goal is to balance by taking a route currently poised to minimize cost, expecting shifts due to participants responding strongly to feedback.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the expected shift and historical behavior, opting for O-R-D again might maximize payoff if others flood O-L-D.

Based on the analysis, for this round, the decision is:

   - Route O-L-D had only one driver, leading to a relatively minimal cost of 220.
   - Players drastically shifted to O-R-D, causing significant congestion and high costs.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - With such extreme congestion on O-R-D, it's almost certain that many drivers will switch to O-L-D to avoid the high costs.
   - Participants tend to overcompensate when reacting to the previous round's congestion, heavily switching to the other route.
   - Recognizing this pattern, a strategic choice minimizes cost by anticipating these shifts.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - Expect a significant number of drivers to move away from O-R-D to O-L-D due to high costs experienced last round.
   - The goal is to select the traditionally less chosen route, expecting a balance shift due to collective player reaction to previous costs.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Opting for route O-L-D seems strategic as it is likely to be chosen by fewer drivers given the heavy congestion on O-R-D in the last round.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the decision for this round is:

   - Your payoff was 40.
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost
     - Therefore, Travel Cost = 400 - 40 = 360, confirming you chose route O-L-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-L-D was heavily congested, leading to a high travel cost of 360.
   - Route O-R-D had significantly fewer drivers, resulting in a lower cost of 240.
   - The pattern observed shows drivers tend to switch routes en masse after experiencing high costs, resulting in oscillations.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - Given the heavy congestion on O-L-D, many drivers are likely to switch to O-R-D.
   - Observing driver behavior from past rounds, participants seem to react strongly by overcompensating for previous high costs.
   - By anticipating this shift, we can strategically position ourselves to minimize travel costs.

4. **Decision-Making**:

   - **Route O-L-D**: 2 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-L-D = 10 * 2 + 210 = 230.
   - **Route O-R-D**: 16 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-R-D = 210 + 10 * 16 = 370.
   - Your payoff was 30.
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost
     - Therefore, Travel Cost = 400 - 30 = 370, confirming you chose route O-R-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-R-D was highly congested with a resulting high cost of 370.
   - Route O-L-D had minimal congestion with a much lower cost of 230.
   - There is a noticeable trend where drivers migrate heavily to one route after seeing it was previously less chosen, leading to congestion on that route.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - Given the severe congestion on O-R-D, there is an expected shift of drivers to O-L-D to avoid the high costs.
   - Historical patterns suggest drivers often react to congestion by switching en masse to the route with fewer drivers.
   - Knowing this behavioral tendency allows us to select a less congested route strategically.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - Anticipate a significant number of drivers will switch from O-R-D to O-L-D after last round's high congestion.
   - Therefore, selecting O-L-D could offer a strategic advantage with potentially lower congestion.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Opting for route O-L-D is strategic, as it anticipates reduced congestion due to participants likely shifting routes to avoid previous high costs.

With these considerations in mind, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

   - Therefore, selecting O-R-D should strategically minimize travel costs due to anticipated lower congestion.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Opting for route O-R-D is sensible, aligning with the expected player movement away from the congested O-L-D.

Based on these considerations, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 2, 'O-R-D': 16}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a strategic decision for this round, let's analyze the past rounds and predict the behavior of other drivers:

1. **Review of Last Round**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 2 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-L-D = 10 * 2 + 210 = 230.
   - **Route O-R-D**: 16 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-R-D = 210 + 10 * 16 = 370.
   - Your payoff was 30.
     - Travel Cost = 400 - 30 = 370, confirming you chose route O-R-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-R-D was heavily congested, resulting in high costs.
   - Route O-L-D was lightly traveled, leading to a lower travel cost.
   - Historically, players tend to switch en masse to avoid congestion, leading to an overcorrection the next round.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - Given the high cost on O-R-D, many drivers will likely switch to O-L-D this time.
   - Players react to the high cost they incur by moving towards the less congested route from the previous round.
   - Anticipating this switch allows for selecting the route expected to have lower congestion.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - Predict a substantial shift from O-R-D to O-L-D due to the previous round's congestion and costs.
   - Opting for O-L-D should reduce potential congestion costs and improve your payoff.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Choosing route O-L-D is strategically sound, expecting many participants to shift away from the congested O-R-D.

Based on this analysis, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```
