System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To determine the optimal route choice, let's consider the cost of each route based on the current situation and strategy for maximizing payoffs:

1. **Understanding the Route Costs:**
   - Route O-L-D: Cost = 10 * X + 210
     where X is the number of drivers choosing the segment O-L.
   - Route O-R-D: Cost = 210 + 10 * Y
     where Y is the number of drivers choosing the segment R-D.

2. **Objective:**
   - Receive an endowment of 400 points each round.
   - Maximize payoff by minimizing cost.
   - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost.

3. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - If many drivers choose one route, its cost increases due to the variable component (10 * X or 10 * Y).
   - Ideally, choose the route with fewer drivers to minimize the variable cost component.

4. **Initial Equal Distribution Hypothesis:**
   - If drivers split evenly across routes (9 on each), both routes initially have similar costs:
     - O-L-D: 10 * 9 + 210 = 300
     - O-R-D: 210 + 10 * 9 = 300

5. **Dynamic Adjustments:**
   - Adjust strategy based on previous round outcomes.
   - If one route is consistently chosen by fewer drivers, it becomes more cost-effective.

6. **Decision in the Absence of Specific Data:**
   - Without information from previous rounds, assume an equal likelihood of route choice from other drivers.
   - Choose a route considering potential reduction in competition:
     - Opt for a less obvious choice initially to reduce cost exposure.
   
7. **Route Selection:**
   - Given the symmetric setup and to potentially minimize costs when others may crowd an obvious choice, consider choosing the route O-R-D initially.
   - This route starts with a fixed cost, and if slightly fewer drivers choose it, the cost becomes more favorable quickly.

Based on this analysis, the strategy is to choose the route 'O-R-D' for the first round.

```json
{
  "route": "O-R-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 7, 'O-R-D': 11}
Your payoff was 80

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the information from the last round, let's analyze the situation to make an informed decision for this round.

1. **Review Last Round Results:**
   - Number of drivers on routes:
     - O-L-D: 7 drivers
     - O-R-D: 11 drivers
   - Your payoff on O-R-D was 80.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs:**
   - Cost of O-R-D: 210 + 10 * 11 = 320
   - Payoff on O-R-D: 400 (endowment) - 320 (cost) = 80
   - The calculation matches your reported payoff, confirming the cost structure was applied correctly.

3. **Analyze Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost would have been: 10 * 7 + 210 = 280
   - Payoff would have been: 400 - 280 = 120

4. **Decide Next Steps:**
   - The route O-L-D was less crowded, and thus had a lower cost.
   - The payoff would have been higher on O-L-D than O-R-D.

5. **Strategy for This Round:**
   - Given the last round's data, it is likely that other players will also notice that O-L-D offered a higher payoff due to fewer drivers.
   - However, consistently choosing the route with fewer drivers can be advantageous over multiple rounds if others do not adjust simultaneously.

6. **Best Prediction:**
   - If trends continue and more players choose O-R-D again, O-L-D could remain less costly.
   - Balancing the likelihood of player movement, O-L-D might still be the more beneficial choice.

7. **Decision:**
   - Choose route O-L-D, anticipating it will still offer a lower cost if not all other drivers immediately switch to it.

Therefore, the decision for this round is to choose the route 'O-L-D'.

```json
{
  "route": "O-L-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 14, 'O-R-D': 4}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the information from the last round, let's analyze and decide on a strategy for the next round.

1. **Review Last Round Results:**
   - Number of drivers on routes:
     - O-L-D: 14 drivers
     - O-R-D: 4 drivers
   - Your payoff on O-L-D was 50.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs:**
   - Cost of O-L-D: 10 * 14 + 210 = 350
   - Payoff on O-L-D: 400 (endowment) - 350 (cost) = 50
   - The calculation for O-L-D matches the reported payoff.

3. **Analyze Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost would have been: 210 + 10 * 4 = 250
   - Payoff would have been: 400 - 250 = 150

4. **Current Situation:**
   - O-L-D became crowded, leading to a high cost.
   - O-R-D, with fewer drivers, resulted in a much lower cost and higher potential payoff.

5. **Strategy Adjustment:**
   - It's likely some drivers will shift back to O-R-D seeking lower costs with fewer drivers.
   - However, many may still choose O-L-D thinking others will prefer staying on O-R-D.

6. **Best Prediction:**
   - Anticipate a shift towards O-R-D by several drivers this round, but possibly not enough to equalize the costs this time immediately.

7. **Decision:**
   - Given the large disparity last round, choose route O-R-D to benefit from lower driver numbers and cost.

Therefore, to optimize payoff based on current trends, choose the route 'O-R-D'.

```json
{
  "route": "O-R-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 4, 'O-R-D': 14}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the information from the last round, let's evaluate the current situation and determine the best strategy for this round.

1. **Review Last Round Results:**
   - Number of drivers on routes:
     - O-L-D: 4 drivers
     - O-R-D: 14 drivers
   - Your payoff on O-R-D was 50.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs:**
   - Cost of O-R-D: 210 + 10 * 14 = 350
   - Payoff on O-R-D: 400 (endowment) - 350 (cost) = 50
   - These calculations confirm your reported payoff on O-R-D.

3. **Analyze Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost would have been: 10 * 4 + 210 = 250
   - Payoff would have been: 400 - 250 = 150

4. **Current Situation:**
   - O-R-D was overcrowded, resulting in a high cost.
   - O-L-D, with fewer drivers, had a significantly lower travel cost and higher potential payoff.

5. **Strategic Insights:**
   - The last round likely demonstrated a large shift of drivers to O-R-D, causing its cost to increase.
   - Many players might have already realized this and may move back to O-L-D.

6. **Expected Driver Behavior:**
   - Given the high cost on O-R-D, more players could shift to O-L-D this round. 
   - However, predicting the exact response can be challenging due to potential balance-seeking by others.

7. **Decision Strategy:**
   - Based on the sharp contrast in costs, choosing O-L-D should provide a more strategic outcome with fewer drivers and lower costs anticipated.

Therefore, considering the substantial number of drivers on O-R-D from last round, the decision is to choose the route 'O-L-D'.

```json
{
  "route": "O-L-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the information from the last round, let's carefully assess the situation and determine the optimal choice for this round.

1. **Review Last Round Results:**
   - Number of drivers on routes:
     - O-L-D: 15 drivers
     - O-R-D: 3 drivers
   - Your payoff on O-L-D was 40.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs:**
   - Cost of O-L-D: 10 * 15 + 210 = 360
   - Payoff on O-L-D: 400 (endowment) - 360 (cost) = 40
   - This matches your reported payoff on O-L-D.

3. **Analyze Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost would have been: 210 + 10 * 3 = 240
   - Payoff would have been: 400 - 240 = 160

4. **Current Analysis:**
   - O-L-D was heavily crowded, leading to a high cost.
   - O-R-D had significantly fewer drivers and would have resulted in a much lower cost and higher payoff.

5. **Strategic Adjustments:**
   - The high number of players on O-L-D suggests they all sought to avoid the previous crowding on O-R-D.
   - This indicates over-adjustment by players in response to prior round conditions.

6. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Given the excessive numbers on O-L-D, it's probable some drivers will move to O-R-D having realized its lower occupancy and cost.
   
7. **Decision Strategy:**
   - Anticipating another shift, but possibly not as severe, the most effective strategy could be to choose O-R-D, which is likely to still have fewer drivers this round.

Based on this analysis and the observed trends, the decision for this round is to choose the route 'O-R-D'.

```json
{
  "route": "O-R-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the results from the last round, let's consider our strategy carefully:

1. **Review Last Round Results:**
   - Number of drivers on routes:
     - O-L-D: 3 drivers
     - O-R-D: 15 drivers
   - Your payoff on O-R-D was 40.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs:**
   - Cost of O-R-D: 210 + 10 * 15 = 360
   - Payoff on O-R-D: 400 (endowment) - 360 (cost) = 40
   - This calculation corroborates your reported payoff.

3. **Analyze Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost would have been: 10 * 3 + 210 = 240
   - Payoff would have been: 400 - 240 = 160

4. **Current Analysis:**
   - O-R-D was significantly crowded, leading to a high cost.
   - O-L-D, with fewer drivers, resulted in a much lower travel cost and a substantially higher potential payoff.

5. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - The large number of drivers moving to O-R-D suggests an overreaction based on previous round dynamics when O-R-D was less crowded.
   - It seems that many players may now recognize the higher cost at O-R-D and could move to O-L-D in response.

6. **Expected Behavior:**
   - It's likely that many players will shift to O-L-D to avoid the high costs at O-R-D observed last round.

7. **Decision Strategy:**
   - Observing the alternating shifts, there’s a high probability that O-L-D will become more crowded this round.
   - Choose O-L-D on the assumption that not all players adjust simultaneously, and it may still present a lower cost opportunity than O-R-D which was severely crowded last round.

Therefore, the decision for this round is to choose the route 'O-L-D', anticipating that costs may still be more favorable despite potential shifts.

```json
{
  "route": "O-L-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision for this round, let's analyze the patterns and outcomes from the previous rounds.

1. **Review Last Round Results:**
   - Number of drivers on routes:
     - O-L-D: 15 drivers
     - O-R-D: 3 drivers
   - Your payoff on O-L-D was 40.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs:**
   - Cost of O-L-D: 10 * 15 + 210 = 360
   - Payoff on O-L-D: 400 (endowment) - 360 (cost) = 40
   - This calculation confirms your payoff experience.

3. **Analyze Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost would have been: 210 + 10 * 3 = 240
   - Payoff would have been: 400 - 240 = 160

4. **Identify Current Trends:**
   - O-L-D was overcrowded, resulting in a very high cost.
   - O-R-D had significantly fewer drivers; this disparity led to a much lower potential cost.

5. **Strategic Analysis:**
   - The switch pattern indicates oscillation due to overreactions among the participants.
   - Given the significant crowding on O-L-D, participants will likely move towards the less crowded O-R-D this round.

6. **Expected Player Movements:**
   - Many players aiming to minimize costs will likely switch away from O-L-D to O-R-D.
   - However, considering previous behaviors, some could hesitate, preventing complete overcrowding on O-R-D.

7. **Decision Strategy:**
   - O-R-D is expected to be less congested, therefore offering lower travel costs.
   - Choose O-R-D, which should be optimal if player shifts happen but do not overfill it.

Hence, based on the analysis and expected driver behavior, choose the route 'O-R-D'.

```json

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the consistent oscillation in driver distribution, let's carefully analyze and decide on a strategy for this round.

1. **Review Last Round Results:**
   - Number of drivers on routes:
     - O-L-D: 3 drivers
     - O-R-D: 15 drivers
   - Your payoff on O-R-D was 40.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs:**
   - Cost of O-R-D: 210 + 10 * 15 = 360
   - Payoff on O-R-D: 400 (endowment) - 360 (cost) = 40
   - This aligns with your reported payoff on O-R-D.

3. **Analyze Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost would have been: 10 * 3 + 210 = 240
   - Payoff would have been: 400 - 240 = 160

4. **Identify Current Trends:**
   - O-R-D remains significantly crowded with high costs.
   - O-L-D, with fewer drivers, resulted in substantially lower costs.

5. **Strategic Analysis:**
   - Consistent oscillation suggests players react strongly to the prior round's costs.
   - O-R-D's high cost might push some drivers to switch to O-L-D this round for potential lower costs.

6. **Expected Driver Behaviors:**
   - Given the cost disparity, many will likely move from O-R-D to O-L-D, expecting to minimize their costs.
   - However, the pattern suggests that not every player adjusts in the same round, allowing for some advantage if anticipated correctly.

7. **Decision Strategy:**
   - O-L-D should present a better opportunity due to likely shifts away from O-R-D.
   - Choosing O-L-D gives a better chance of encountering fewer drivers, given the oscillating trend.

Based on this analysis and the expectation of driver behavior patterns, the decision for this round is to choose the route 'O-L-D'.

```json
{
  "route": "O-L-D"

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the results from the last round and the oscillating pattern we've observed, let's carefully assess and decide on the best strategy for this round.

1. **Review Last Round Results:**
   - Number of drivers on routes:
     - O-L-D: 16 drivers
     - O-R-D: 2 drivers
   - Your payoff on O-L-D was 30.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs:**
   - Cost of O-L-D: 10 * 16 + 210 = 370
   - Payoff on O-L-D: 400 (endowment) - 370 (cost) = 30
   - This aligns with your reported payoff.

3. **Analyze Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost would have been: 210 + 10 * 2 = 230
   - Payoff would have been: 400 - 230 = 170

4. **Trend Analysis:**
   - O-L-D was heavily crowded, resulting in extremely high costs.
   - O-R-D had very few drivers and therefore lower costs.

5. **Strategic Insights:**
   - There has been consistent over-adjustment by players, switching routes drastically based on the previous round's costs.
   - The pattern indicates a significant chance that large numbers of drivers will move from O-L-D to O-R-D.

6. **Behavioral Expectation:**
   - Many will likely shift to O-R-D, attracted by its significantly lower cost in the previous round.
   - However, if the shifts are gradual, O-R-D may still not reach overcrowding levels immediately.

7. **Decision Strategy:**
   - Choose O-R-D with the anticipation that although shifts may occur, it should still be more cost-efficient than O-L-D.
   - This choice is based on the likelihood that not all players will adjust this round, leaving O-R-D with a potentially lower driver count.

Therefore, based on the analysis and observing the trend, the most strategic decision for this round is to choose the route 'O-R-D'.

   - This calculation confirms your reported payoff.

3. **Analyze Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost would have been: 10 * 1 + 210 = 220
   - Payoff would have been: 400 - 220 = 180

4. **Trend and Pattern Analysis:**
   - O-R-D was overcrowded, leading to very high costs.
   - O-L-D, with only 1 driver, had significantly lower costs and thus higher potential payoff.

5. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - The drastic switch indicates that players are reacting strongly to cost variations from previous rounds.
   - It is expected that many players will now recognize the low cost on O-L-D and shift to it.

6. **Expected Driver Behavior:**
   - Due to the extreme overcrowding on O-R-D, many players are likely to move back to O-L-D.
   - However, if not all players switch, costs on O-R-D may still be higher.

7. **Decision Strategy:**
   - Choose O-L-D, as the likelihood indicates it remains the route with potential for fewer drivers and lower costs.
   - The pattern suggests this should invite more players to switch, improving payoff.

Therefore, based on these observations and the likelihood of typical player reactions, the decision for this round is to choose the route 'O-L-D'.

   - O-R-D had only 1 driver, resulting in the lowest possible cost.

5. **Strategic Insights:**
   - The participants are switching en masse based on prior high-cost rounds.
   - Knowing that O-L-D resulted in high costs and that most players react to this by switching, players are likely to move towards O-R-D now.

6. **Expected Player Behavior:**
   - With last round’s high costs on O-L-D, many players should shift to O-R-D.
   - An extremely low number of players on O-R-D last round indicates some hesitation to switch too abruptly.

7. **Decision Strategy:**
   - Expect others to switch to O-R-D based on recent results, but the switch might not overcrowd it immediately.
   - Choose O-R-D for potentially fewer drivers and lower costs than expected on O-L-D now.

Therefore, based on previous rounds and players' tendencies to adjust, the decision for this round is to choose the route 'O-R-D'.

5. **Strategic Insights:**
   - Historically, players switch significantly in response to high costs in the prior round.
   - Given the high cost from last round on O-R-D, drivers will be incentivized to switch to O-L-D.

6. **Expected Driver Behavior:**
   - Players recognizing the low cost will likely shift to O-L-D, moving away from the congested O-R-D.
   - Given the pattern, not every player will switch suddenly, which can keep O-L-D costs relatively low but competitive.

7. **Decision Strategy:**
   - Since O-R-D was highly crowded, anticipate a considerable shift back to O-L-D.
   - Choose O-L-D for anticipated lower cost due to expected reduced driver count compared to last round's O-R-D.

Based on these observations and the predictable nature of players reacting to previous costs, the decision for this round is to choose the route 'O-L-D'.

3. **Analyze Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost would have been: 210 + 10 * 3 = 240
   - Payoff would have been: 400 - 240 = 160

4. **Identify Current Trends:**
   - O-L-D was excessively crowded, leading to high costs.
   - O-R-D had significantly fewer drivers, offering a much lower cost.

5. **Strategic Analysis:**
   - The number of players on O-L-D indicates a major swing from previous rounds, likely in reaction to past outcomes.
   - Recognizing these patterns, many players may now consider O-R-D to seek a lower cost.

6. **Expected Driver Movement:**
   - Drivers will likely adjust and move towards the less crowded O-R-D, given the previous round's results.
   - As players respond to the crowded conditions of O-L-D, O-R-D is expected to present a more balanced cost scenario.

7. **Decision Strategy:**
   - Opt for route O-R-D, anticipating that many drivers will switch to capture the lower costs.

Therefore, based on the pattern of significant swings and current expectations of driver reactions, the decision for this round is to choose the route 'O-R-D'.

   - Payoff would have been: 400 - 230 = 170

4. **Current Trends and Patterns:**
   - O-R-D was highly crowded, leading to very high costs.
   - O-L-D had significantly fewer drivers, offering a much lower cost alternative.

5. **Strategic Insights:**
   - Players tend to overreact to previous costs, resulting in large shifts between routes.
   - Due to the severe crowding on O-R-D, players are likely to switch routes.

6. **Expected Driver Movements:**
   - Many drivers will likely move to O-L-D, having seen the lower cost from last round.
   - Historical oscillation patterns suggest not all players will instantly switch, but O-L-D will become more popular.

   - The pattern suggests that not all players move simultaneously, so O-L-D may still maintain a lower cost.

7. **Decision Strategy:**
   - Opt for O-L-D, expecting that it will have fewer drivers than O-R-D and thereby achieve a cost-efficient outcome.
   - This approach is based on minimizing personal travel costs by taking advantage of anticipated route shifts.

Therefore, relying on these strategic analyses, the decision for this round is to choose the route 'O-L-D'.

```json
{
  "route": "O-L-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision this round, let's analyze the situation step-by-step, using patterns from previous rounds to guide our choice:

1. **Review Last Round Results:**
   - Number of drivers on routes:
     - O-L-D: 16 drivers
     - O-R-D: 2 drivers
   - Your payoff on O-L-D was 30.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs:**
   - Cost of O-L-D: 10 * 16 + 210 = 370
   - Payoff on O-L-D: 400 (endowment) - 370 (cost) = 30
   - This matches your recorded payoff.

3. **Analyze Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost would have been: 210 + 10 * 2 = 230
   - Payoff would have been: 400 - 230 = 170

4. **Recognize Current Patterns:**
   - O-L-D was overcrowded, resulting in very high costs.
   - O-R-D was significantly less crowded, offering a lower cost scenario.

5. **Strategic Insights:**
   - Historical patterns suggest players react to high costs by switching routes to escape congestion.
   - The current overcrowding on O-L-D indicates a likely shift towards O-R-D by players seeking to lower costs.

6. **Predicted Driver Movements:**
   - Many players are likely to switch to O-R-D, where they could benefit from potential cost reductions compared to the crowded O-L-D.
   - The expected shift aligns with typical behavioral patterns following rounds of high congestion.

7. **Decision Strategy:**
   - Opt for O-R-D, as it is anticipated that this route will remain less crowded and offer lower travel costs than O-L-D.
   - This choice is designed to maximize payoff by leveraging the expected decrease in congestion on O-R-D.

Based on this comprehensive evaluation, the decision for this round is to select the route 'O-R-D'.

```json
{
  "route": "O-R-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 2, 'O-R-D': 16}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a strategic decision for this round, let's review the patterns and recent results carefully:

1. **Review Last Round Results:**
   - Number of drivers on routes:
     - O-L-D: 2 drivers
     - O-R-D: 16 drivers
   - Your payoff on O-R-D was 30.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs:**
   - Cost of O-R-D: 210 + 10 * 16 = 370
   - Payoff on O-R-D: 400 (endowment) - 370 (cost) = 30
   - This matches the reported payoff.

3. **Analyze Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost would have been: 10 * 2 + 210 = 230
   - Payoff would have been: 400 - 230 = 170

4. **Identify Current Patterns:**
   - O-R-D was heavily populated, leading to high costs.
   - O-L-D had far fewer drivers, leading to significantly lower costs.

5. **Strategic Insights:**
   - Players consistently react to the previous round’s high costs by switching en masse to the route with fewer drivers.
   - Given O-R-D’s high cost last round, it’s probable that players will start moving towards O-L-D.

6. **Expected Driver Movements:**
   - A substantial shift to O-L-D can be expected as players seek to mitigate costs.
   - Observing past patterns, the adjustment typically involves significant moves but not necessarily all at once.

7. **Decision Strategy:**
   - Choose O-L-D, anticipating that it will have a more balanced number of drivers this round, potentially lowering the cost.
   - This decision aims to take advantage of anticipated player shifts away from an overcrowded O-R-D.

Based on these observations and expected behavioral adjustments, the strategic decision for this round is to choose the route 'O-L-D'.
