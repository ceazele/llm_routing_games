System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an optimal decision on which route to choose between 'O-L-D' and 'O-R-D', let's break down the decision process step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Cost Structure**:
   - Route 'O-L-D' has a cost of `10 * X + 210`, where `X` is the number of drivers choosing segment 'O-L'.
   - Route 'O-R-D' has a cost of `210 + 10 * Y`, where `Y` is the number of drivers choosing segment 'R-D'.

2. **Initial Endowment**: You start each round with 400 points. The goal is to minimize the travel cost to maximize the remaining points.

3. **Analyze Costs**:
   - The cost for 'O-L-D' increases with more drivers on segment 'O-L', starting at 220 when you're the only one on this route (i.e., `X = 1`).
   - The cost for 'O-R-D' increases with more drivers on segment 'R-D', starting at 220 when you're the only one on this route (i.e., `Y = 1`).

4. **Consider Other Drivers' Choices**:
   - If more drivers choose 'O-L-D', its cost increases, making 'O-R-D' potentially more appealing if it remains less crowded.
   - Conversely, if more drivers choose 'O-R-D', the cost for that route increases, potentially making 'O-L-D' the better option if fewer drivers choose it.

5. **Strategic Decision**:
   - Since all drivers aim to minimize costs, they may try to balance between the routes.
   - Historically (or assuming prior behavior), you might expect an even distribution initially. However, drivers may adjust based on past rounds' outcomes.
   - If, in previous rounds, you noticed a pattern of many drivers choosing 'O-L-D', you might anticipate less traffic on 'O-R-D' in the next round, and vice versa.

6. **Choose the Route**:
   - Given the symmetric nature of the problem and assuming no prior specific trend, a starting strategy could be to choose randomly or based on slight inclinations from past rounds.
   - If you have specific insights (e.g., recent observations about more traffic on one route), leverage that.

For this example (without additional historical pattern data), a balanced approach might be simply to alternate or begin by choosing one of the routes, especially if the past rounds do not give clear indicators of overcrowding on one.

Let's choose 'O-L-D' to start, assuming no prior dominant strategy is apparent without leaning towards one due to alternating strategy convenience.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 7, 'O-R-D': 11}
Your payoff was 120

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the information from the last round and aiming to make a more informed decision, let's re-evaluate the situation:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 7 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 11 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 120 points.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 7 + 210 = 280 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 11 = 320 points`.
   - Last round, if you chose 'O-R-D' based on your payoff of 120 (400 - 280), it seems you actually chose 'O-L-D'.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-R-D' was costlier due to more drivers, which made your choice of 'O-L-D' a relatively better one last round.
   - If the distribution remains similar, choosing 'O-L-D' again could continue to provide a lower cost compared to 'O-R-D'.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - Other drivers might notice that 'O-R-D' was more costly and decide to switch to 'O-L-D', increasing traffic there.
   - Some drivers on 'O-L-D' might stick with their choice if they had a better payoff compared to 'O-R-D'.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Given the prior reliable outcome with 'O-L-D', you might opt to continue with 'O-L-D', assuming not all drivers will switch away from 'O-R-D'.
   - If too many switch, the cost will rise; however, the risk is that both routes may reach a similar high cost if distribution evens out.

6. **Decision**:
   - Since last round resulted in a favorable outcome and considering the herd mentality where not all drivers change immediately, a prudent decision is to choose 'O-L-D' again this round.

Therefore, the chosen strategy for this round is to stay on 'O-L-D', to potentially maintain a lower cost if driver distribution remains relatively favorable.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 14, 'O-R-D': 4}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the situation and make a more informed decision based on the latest update:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 14 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 4 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 50 points.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 14 + 210 = 350 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 4 = 250 points`.
   - Your payoff of 50 points indicates you were on 'O-L-D', which was significantly more crowded and costly.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-L-D' became highly crowded, driving the costs up.
   - 'O-R-D' was less crowded and consequently had a lower travel cost.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - Drivers who chose 'O-L-D' will likely notice their high costs and consider switching to 'O-R-D'.
   - Assuming rational behavior, some of the 14 drivers from 'O-L-D' will switch to 'O-R-D' to capitalize on its lower costs.
   - Consequently, 'O-R-D' might receive a few more drivers, but the cost could still be more favorable compared to the overcrowded 'O-L-D'.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Given the high congestion on 'O-L-D', switching to 'O-R-D', which has fewer drivers, is a good strategy if seeking a lower cost.
   - 'O-R-D' currently offers a more favorable cost, and with expected redistribution, it might still remain advantageous.

6. **Decision**:
   - Opt for 'O-R-D' to potentially benefit from a lower travel cost, as others from 'O-L-D' might not all switch in one round, keeping 'O-R-D' relatively low in congestion.

Based on this analysis, choose route 'O-R-D' for this round.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 4, 'O-R-D': 14}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's evaluate the current situation carefully to make a well-informed decision for the next round:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 4 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 14 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 50 points.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 4 + 210 = 250 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 14 = 350 points`.
   - Your low payoff indicates you chose 'O-R-D', which had become crowded and thus costly.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-R-D' became highly congested, causing the cost to rise significantly.
   - 'O-L-D', with fewer drivers, offered a lower travel cost last round.
   
4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - Drivers who experienced high costs on 'O-R-D' will likely consider switching to the less congested 'O-L-D'.
   - It's reasonable to predict a shift of some drivers from 'O-R-D' to 'O-L-D'.
   - However, the current number of drivers on 'O-R-D' suggests it might still remain more crowded.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Based on the current rotation dynamics, shifting to 'O-L-D' might yield a lower cost, anticipating that not all 14 drivers on 'O-R-D' will switch immediately.
   - Monitoring such patterns can maximize the chances of moving to a less crowded route offering better payoffs.

6. **Decision**:
   - Given the current trend, choosing 'O-L-D' is a strategic move to leverage its current lower congestion and potential lower cost.

Therefore, the decision is to switch to route 'O-L-D' for the next round.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the current scenario and make an informed decision for the next round:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 15 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 3 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 40 points.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 15 + 210 = 360 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 3 = 240 points`.
   - Your low payoff indicates you chose 'O-L-D', which was very crowded and resulted in a high cost.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-L-D' became highly congested, pushing the cost up.
   - 'O-R-D', with only 3 drivers, was the cheaper option last round.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - Many drivers who experienced high costs on 'O-L-D' are likely to switch to 'O-R-D', which had significantly lower costs.
   - This switch could lead to 'O-R-D' becoming more congested in the next round, but currently, it seems like the better choice given the existing distribution.
   
5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - The likelihood of overcrowding is now higher on 'O-L-D' given driver dissatisfaction with high costs, making 'O-R-D' potentially a better current strategy.
   - Switching to 'O-R-D' should be advantageous if we anticipate drivers will redistribute significantly away from 'O-L-D'.

6. **Decision**:
   - Choosing 'O-R-D' is sensible as it was less crowded last round, and many drivers may switch to it after observing the high congestion on 'O-L-D'.

The decision is to opt for route 'O-R-D' for this round, expecting it to offer lower costs due to less congestion.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's approach the decision systematically, given the information and past trends:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 3 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 15 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 40 points.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 3 + 210 = 240 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 15 = 360 points`.
   - The low payoff indicates you chose 'O-R-D', which was heavily congested and costly.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-R-D' attracted a high number of drivers, leading to increased congestion and higher costs.
   - 'O-L-D', with only 3 drivers, offered a much lower cost.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - It's highly likely drivers will recognize the high cost of 'O-R-D' from the last round and will switch back to 'O-L-D'.
   - This change could lead to 'O-L-D' becoming slightly more crowded, but it might still remain more economical if not all 15 drivers switch at once.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Switching to 'O-L-D' is the logical choice as it offered significantly lower costs.
   - It's expected that some drivers will transfer to 'O-L-D' for lower costs, but given the imbalance, it should still be the preferable route.

6. **Decision**:
   - Opt for 'O-L-D', as it was underutilized and thus cheaper in the last round, and predict the redistribution will not overcrowd it immediately.

Therefore, the prudent choice is to choose route 'O-L-D' for this next round.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's take a strategic approach based on the pattern we are observing to make a well-informed decision:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 15 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 3 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 40 points, indicating you were on 'O-L-D', which was heavily crowded and thus costly.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 15 + 210 = 360 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 3 = 240 points`.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-L-D' is highly congested, leading to high costs.
   - 'O-R-D' was far less congested and offered a lower cost last round.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - Given the high cost on 'O-L-D', it is likely that many drivers will switch to 'O-R-D' to benefit from its lower costs.
   - There could be a significant shift in drivers from 'O-L-D' to 'O-R-D', as they seek to avoid the high congestion experienced last round.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Switching to 'O-R-D' is advisable, as it is currently underutilized and offers a more favorable cost if fewer drivers remain.
   - While there may be a switch, it's unlikely that all 15 drivers will move at once, potentially keeping 'O-R-D' still advantageous.

6. **Decision**:
   - Opt for 'O-R-D', as the lower congestion pattern suggests a reduced cost, and many other drivers might not switch immediately, making it a less risky choice.

To adapt strategically, the recommended choice this round is to select route 'O-R-D'.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the fluctuations in the choices of routes over recent rounds, let's carefully plan the decision-making process for this upcoming round:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 3 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 15 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 40 points, indicating that you chose 'O-R-D', which was overcrowded.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 3 + 210 = 240 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 15 = 360 points`.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-R-D' was significantly congested and resulted in high costs.
   - 'O-L-D', with only 3 drivers, was a much cheaper option.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - Observing these trends, many drivers from 'O-R-D' will likely switch to 'O-L-D' to avoid the high costs.
   - However, historical patterns suggest there may be a delay or reluctance for all drivers to switch immediately, making 'O-L-D' potentially advantageous still in the short term.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Given this pattern, it may be strategic to switch to 'O-L-D', anticipating that it will still have fewer drivers initially.
   - It's reasonable to expect that not all drivers will switch routes simultaneously, keeping 'O-L-D' sufficiently less crowded.

6. **Decision**:
   - Choose 'O-L-D', leveraging the expectation that some drivers remain on 'O-R-D' and hoping 'O-L-D' stays less congested than 'O-R-D'.

Therefore, the decision for this next round is to select route 'O-L-D', expecting it to offer a lower cost due to reduced congestion.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a strategic decision for the next round, let's carefully analyze the pattern, considering the latest result and trends:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 16 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 2 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 30 points, indicating you chose 'O-L-D', which was overcrowded and, therefore, very costly.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 16 + 210 = 370 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 2 = 230 points`.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-L-D' became extremely congested, leading to high costs.
   - 'O-R-D', with only 2 drivers, had a relatively low cost.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - Given the extraordinarily high cost on 'O-L-D', many drivers are likely to switch to 'O-R-D' in the next round to reduce their costs.
   - However, not everyone may switch immediately, and drivers may expect some will remain, thus trying to balance choices.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Switching to 'O-R-D' is advisable, as it had significantly lower costs last round.
   - It's expected that many drivers from 'O-L-D' will move to 'O-R-D', but starting with much lower congestion means 'O-R-D' is likely still the better option next round.

6. **Decision**:
   - Opt for 'O-R-D', anticipating a better payoff due to lower congestion based on the last round's experiences.

Based on the analysis, the strategic decision is to choose route 'O-R-D'.

```json

   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 17 = 380 points`.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-R-D' became highly congested, which led to very high costs.
   - 'O-L-D', with only 1 driver, offered the lowest potential cost.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - Given the excessive cost of 'O-R-D', it is highly likely that a large number of drivers will switch to 'O-L-D' to minimize costs.
   - Conversely, a much smaller number on 'O-L-D' indicates it was significantly underutilized.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Switching to 'O-L-D' is the logical choice given its drastically lower cost last round.
   - While some drivers will likely switch, it's improbable that all 17 drivers will move to 'O-L-D' immediately, maintaining a relatively lower cost there.

6. **Decision**:
   - Select 'O-L-D', expecting it to still offer a lower cost due to the lower initial congestion and profitability.

Based on the analysis, the decision is to choose route 'O-L-D'.

```json

```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 17, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To strategically decide for the upcoming round, let's break down the current situation:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 17 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 1 driver chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 20 points, indicating you chose 'O-L-D', which was very crowded and costly.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 17 + 210 = 380 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 1 = 220 points`.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-L-D' was extremely overcrowded, resulting in high costs.
   - 'O-R-D', with only 1 driver, was the significantly cheaper route.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - With such a high cost on 'O-L-D', a substantial number of drivers are likely to switch to 'O-R-D' in search of lower costs.
   - 'O-R-D' had much lower congestion, making it the preferable route.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Switching to 'O-R-D' is advisable, as its cost was substantially lower last round.
   - There is usually a balancing act as drivers redistribute, but it is unlikely that all 17 drivers will switch to 'O-R-D' at once.

6. **Decision**:
   - Choose 'O-R-D', as it was underutilized last round and should remain more cost-effective if even a moderate switch occurs.

Therefore, the decision for this round is to choose route 'O-R-D'.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 1, 'O-R-D': 17}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's review the recent dynamics and decide strategically for the upcoming round:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 1 driver chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 17 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 20 points, indicating you chose 'O-R-D', which was extremely congested and costly.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 1 + 210 = 220 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 17 = 380 points`.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-R-D' has been severely overcrowded, causing high penalties in cost.
   - 'O-L-D', having only 1 driver, offered a much more economical choice.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - Given the consistently high cost and congestion on 'O-R-D', many drivers will likely switch to 'O-L-D' to seek lower costs.
   - Although some drivers may switch, it's improbable all will move simultaneously, leaving 'O-R-D' less crowded this round.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Switching to 'O-L-D' is a high-probability choice for a lower cost, as it was much cheaper last round.
   - With overly high congestion currently on 'O-R-D', drivers generally tend to spread out in subsequent rounds.

6. **Decision**:
   - Select 'O-L-D', anticipating a better payoff resulting from its lower congestion and therefore cost.

Based on this analysis, the decision is to select route 'O-L-D' for this round. 

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```
