System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a decision about which route to take, we need to analyze the costs associated with each route and estimate how other participants might choose their routes. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Cost Functions:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** The cost is calculated as \(10X + 210\), where \(X\) is the number of drivers choosing this route. The cost depends linearly on the number of drivers due to the segment O-L.
   - **Route O-R-D:** The cost is \(210 + 10Y\), where \(Y\) is the number of drivers choosing this route. Like the other route, this cost also depends linearly on the number of drivers, but due to the segment R-D.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - Everyone starts with an endowment of 400 points.
   - The goal is to minimize travel costs and thus maximize remaining points from the endowment.

3. **Deciding a Strategy:**
   - **If More Players Choose O-L-D:** The cost for O-L-D will increase significantly due to the \(10X\) factor on O-L. Choosing O-R-D may be advantageous if few people opt for it, keeping \(10Y\) lower.
   - **If More Players Choose O-R-D:** Similarly, the cost for O-R-D will rise if many players choose it, making O-L-D potentially more advantageous.

4. **Consideration of Equilibrium:**
   - Both routes include a fixed cost of 210. The decision should hinge on balancing the variable cost component of each route given the expected choices of other players.

5. **Predicting Opponent Behavior:**
   - Given 18 players, a naive equal split would be 9 players per route. However, players might gravitate towards whichever route they think will be less congested, aiming for lower cost.
   - It's critical to estimate how many might be thinking conservatively versus those acting on instinct or strategy.

6. **Choice of Route:**
   - Since both bottlenecks (O-L and R-D) have the same multiplier (10), the attractiveness of each route dynamically changes each round based on previous congestion experiences.
   - For the sake of a starting round without prior congestion knowledge, a balanced yet slightly contrarian position might be useful.

7. **Decision:**
   - Assume an average case where players might choose conservatively or slightly sway towards one route or another without complete bias towards either.
   - Aiming for perceived lesser congestion, a choice will be made.

Considering these analyses and without precise data on how the previous rounds have distributed the players, a rational initial strategy is to take a calculated risk on one route, say 'O-R-D', starting with the assumption it might initially be less chosen due to its constant endpoint cost segment.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 7, 'O-R-D': 11}
Your payoff was 80

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the situation given the results from the last round and make an informed decision for this round.

1. **Review of Last Round's Results:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** 7 players chose this route.
   - **Route O-R-D:** 11 players chose this route.
   - Your payoff was 80 points, which means your travel cost was \(400 - 80 = 320\).

2. **Cost Calculation for Last Round:**
   - For **Route O-L-D**: The cost would be \(10 \times 7 + 210 = 280\).
   - For **Route O-R-D** (chosen by you): The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 11 = 320\).

3. **Analysis:**
   - Your choice resulted in a higher travel cost compared to the other route.
   - This suggests that Route O-L-D would have been cheaper by 40 points last round.

4. **Predicting Player Behavior for This Round:**
   - Players who chose O-R-D might switch to O-L-D because it was cheaper last round.
   - Conversely, players who were on O-L-D may decide to stay since it was the better choice.

5. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - There's a possibility more players might shift to O-L-D, driving up its cost.
   - If too many players move to O-L-D, O-R-D might become a better choice due to reduced congestion.
   
6. **Using Equilibrium Thinking:**
   - Considering last round’s outcome, many might think shifting to O-L-D will still be optimal. However, if too many do, the cost will balance or even surpass O-R-D.

7. **Optimization:**
   - The goal is to avoid congestion and pick the path which becomes less crowded this round.
   - Given the last round’s trend and potential player shift, a counter-move may be warranted.

8. **Decision:**
   - Opt for the route where fewer players are likely to go based on adaptive predictions.

Considering these points and predicting potential shifts in player behavior, opting for Route 'O-L-D' might be cost-effective if players overreact in switching, but to align with risk mitigation, let's stick with Route 'O-R-D' as a conservative choice countering potential over-congestion in O-L-D.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 14, 'O-R-D': 4}
Your payoff was 150

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the situation for this round based on the information from the last round and make an informed decision.

1. **Review of Last Round's Results:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** 14 players chose this route.
   - **Route O-R-D:** 4 players chose this route.
   - Your payoff was 150 points, which means your travel cost was \(400 - 150 = 250\).

2. **Cost Calculation for Last Round:**
   - For **Route O-L-D**: The cost was \(10 \times 14 + 210 = 350\).
   - For **Route O-R-D** (chosen by you): The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 4 = 250\).

3. **Analysis:**
   - Your choice of O-R-D resulted in a lower travel cost compared to O-L-D.
   - This outcome reflects that O-R-D was significantly cheaper by 100 points last round.

4. **Predicting Player Behavior for This Round:**
   - Players on O-L-D last round experienced high costs, so many may attempt to switch to O-R-D.
   - The dynamics of player movement can lead to a potential increase in the number of players choosing O-R-D.

5. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - Expect some players from the costly O-L-D path to migrate to O-R-D, attempting to take advantage of its previous cost efficiency.
   - However, if too many players switch to O-R-D, congestion could quickly increase the cost.

6. **Using Equilibrium Thinking:**
   - Players frequently react to the previous round's costs, leading to possible swings each round.
   - Anticipate that players will balance out if they recognize a changing trend.

7. **Optimization:**
   - The goal is to avoid being on the congested route. Choose the route with the expectation of fewer players.
   - Based on last round's results, while O-R-D is likely to receive more players, O-L-D might still have fewer players than two rounds ago.

8. **Decision:**
   - Opt for the route with potentially fewer players, anticipating behavior adjustments.

Understanding these principles, switching to Route 'O-L-D' might offer a cost advantage this round, as the crowd moves to exploit O-R-D. Here's the decision:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 4, 'O-R-D': 14}
Your payoff was 150

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the current situation and consider the previous round's results to make a strategic decision for this round.

1. **Review of Last Round's Results:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** 4 players chose this route.
   - **Route O-R-D:** 14 players chose this route.
   - Your payoff was 150 points, implying a travel cost of \(400 - 150 = 250\).

2. **Cost Calculation for Last Round:**
   - For **Route O-L-D**: The cost was \(10 \times 4 + 210 = 250\).
   - For **Route O-R-D** (where you were): The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 14 = 350\).

3. **Analysis:**
   - Previous choice of O-R-D resulted in higher costs (by 100 points) than O-L-D for you.
   - O-L-D was less congested and thus cheaper, with only 4 players vs. 14 on O-R-D.

4. **Predicting Player Behavior for This Round:**
   - Many players on O-R-D experienced high costs, and they may switch to O-L-D to minimize these costs.
   - This could lead to an increase in congestion on O-L-D if too many make the switch.

5. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - There might be a significant shift of participants to O-L-D due to its previous low cost.
   - If too many players switch, O-R-D could become cost-effective once again due to reduced congestion.

6. **Using Equilibrium Thinking:**
   - Often, players overcorrect by shifting en masse to the previously less congested route.
   - Timing the switch to stay ahead of the curve can reduce costs.

7. **Optimization:**
   - Anticipate shifts and aim for the route with expected lower congestion.
   - Consider the natural pendulum swing in equilibrating dynamics.

8. **Decision:**
   - Opt for the route now anticipated to be less crowded, accounting for the overreaction of other players.

Given these insights and predicting possible over-correction behavior from other players, switching back to Route 'O-R-D' might yield lower costs as it could be less crowded due to shifts towards O-L-D.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the previous round's results and make an informed decision for this round.

1. **Review of Last Round's Results:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** 15 players chose this route.
   - **Route O-R-D:** 3 players chose this route.
   - Your payoff was 160 points, which means your travel cost was \(400 - 160 = 240\).

2. **Cost Calculation for Last Round:**
   - For **Route O-L-D**: The cost was \(10 \times 15 + 210 = 360\).
   - For **Route O-R-D** (chosen by you): The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 3 = 240\).

3. **Analysis:**
   - Your choice of O-R-D resulted in a lower travel cost compared to O-L-D, which was much more congested.
   - O-L-D was significantly more expensive last round by 120 points due to congestion.

4. **Predicting Player Behavior for This Round:**
   - Players on O-L-D last round likely experienced high costs and may switch to O-R-D seeking lower costs.
   - There's likely to be a notable shift from O-L-D to O-R-D following the observed cost disparity.

5. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - Anticipate that many players will shift to O-R-D, given its lower cost last round.
   - However, if too many switch to O-R-D, congestion will increase, elevating its cost.

6. **Using Equilibrium Thinking:**
   - Players often shift based on prior rounds' performances, creating alternating traffic patterns.
   - Predict the tendency toward equilibrium as players adjust their routes based on perceived advantages.

7. **Optimization:**
   - Aim to select the route that might now be less congested as previous players attempt to balance route choices.
   - Predict that players will move en masse towards the previously cheaper option, potentially over-congesting it.

8. **Decision:**
   - With the expectation that many participants may now shift to O-R-D, consider taking the less crowded O-L-D, assuming some players might overcorrect their strategy.

Given these points and considering the likely over-correction of players to the less-congested route last round, opting for Route 'O-L-D' could potentially yield lower costs if many players shift to O-R-D.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Choosing O-R-D resulted in higher costs due to high congestion, while O-L-D was significantly cheaper.
   - O-L-D cost 120 points less than O-R-D due to lower congestion.

4. **Predicting Player Behavior for This Round:**
   - Many players on O-R-D might switch to O-L-D in response to its lower cost.
   - This suggests that O-L-D might see increased traffic if players react to the previous round's costs.

5. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - It is likely that players will shift in large numbers to O-L-D to capitalize on its previous advantage.
   - If too many shift, the congestion on O-L-D will increase, making O-R-D potentially cheaper.

6. **Using Equilibrium Thinking:**
   - Anticipate mass shifts based on previous outcomes, knowing players aim to reduce costs.
   - Consider how players' shifts might restore balance between the costs of the two routes.

7. **Optimization:**

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 170

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's make an informed decision for this round by analyzing the previous round's outcomes and anticipating potential player behavior:

1. **Review of Last Round’s Results:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** 16 players chose this route.
   - **Route O-R-D:** 2 players chose this route.
   - Your payoff was 170 points, indicating a travel cost of \(400 - 170 = 230\).

2. **Cost Calculation for Last Round:**
   - For **Route O-L-D:** The cost was \(10 \times 16 + 210 = 370\).
   - For **Route O-R-D:** The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 230\).

3. **Analysis:**
   - O-L-D was heavily congested, resulting in high travel costs.
   - O-R-D was significantly less congested and thus cheaper.

4. **Predicting Player Behavior for This Round:**
   - Players who experienced high costs on O-L-D may likely switch to O-R-D in search of reduced costs.
   - This anticipated migration could increase congestion on O-R-D.

5. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - If many players switch to O-R-D, it could become congested.
   - Simultaneously, O-L-D might experience reduced congestion if players move away.

6. **Using Equilibrium Thinking:**
   - Changes in route congestion often lead players to switch routes, resulting in cyclic pattern differences.
   - Utilize this knowledge to help predict which route may be less congested.

7. **Optimization:**
   - Choose the route anticipated to have fewer players based on the likely player adjustments.

8. **Decision:**
   - Considering that many players might switch to O-R-D for lower costs, selecting the less congested O-L-D could be advantageous.

Based on these insights and predicting a player shift towards O-R-D, choosing Route 'O-L-D' might be beneficial if it becomes less congested due to players overcorrecting their previous strategies.

   - Your payoff was 170 points, indicating a travel cost of \(400 - 170 = 230\).

2. **Cost Calculation for Last Round:**
   - For **Route O-L-D:** The cost was \(10 \times 2 + 210 = 230\).
   - For **Route O-R-D:** The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 16 = 370\).

3. **Analysis:**
   - O-L-D was very lightly used, leading to lower costs.
   - O-R-D was heavily used, making it considerably more expensive.

4. **Predicting Player Behavior for This Round:**
   - Players who experienced high costs on O-R-D are likely looking to switch to O-L-D due to its lower costs last round.
   - This shift could result in more players choosing O-L-D this round, increasing its congestion.

5. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - With a likely player shift toward O-L-D, congestion could increase there if enough players switch.
   - Conversely, O-R-D might see reduced congestion if players migrate away.

6. **Using Equilibrium Thinking:**
   - Players reacting to previous round costs often create predictable patterns of congestion and route choice.
   - Utilize this anticipatory thinking to choose a potentially less crowded route.

7. **Optimization:**
   - Choose the route expected to draw fewer players based on anticipated shifts in player decisions.

8. **Decision:**
   - Given the expected movement towards O-L-D due to its previous low cost, it might be strategic to select Route 'O-R-D' if it becomes less congested.

Considering these factors and assuming a significant shift towards O-L-D, choosing Route 'O-R-D' could be advantageous if it experiences reduced congestion as players adjust to the prior round's outcomes.

   - For **Route O-R-D:** The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 230\).

3. **Analysis:**
   - O-L-D was crowded and had high costs due to significant congestion.
   - O-R-D was less crowded and cheaper, which benefited the few players who chose it.

4. **Predicting Player Behavior for This Round:**
   - Many players who experienced high costs on O-L-D will likely switch to O-R-D seeking the visible cost advantage.
   - This expected shift could increase congestion on O-R-D.

5. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - Anticipate a significant movement towards O-R-D, which could potentially make it more congested.
   - If enough players move to O-R-D, O-L-D might become the less congested option.

6. **Using Equilibrium Thinking:**
   - The player behavior typically oscillates based on previous experiences with route costs, often resulting in a balancing cycle.
   - Predict these shifts to decide which route might experience fewer players.

7. **Optimization:**
   - Choose the route expected to have fewer players, capitalizing on predicted overreactions or mass shifts.

8. **Decision:**
   - Considering a substantial potential switch to O-R-D, selecting the less crowded O-L-D could be advantageous.

Based on these insights and anticipating a noticeable shift toward O-R-D, selecting Route 'O-L-D' might be beneficial if it sees reduced congestion as players adjust in response to high costs.

System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a strategic decision, let's evaluate the potential costs and benefits of each route, considering the likely choices of other participants.

1. **Understand the Cost Structure for Each Route:**

   - **Route O-L-D:** 
     - Travel Cost = \(10X + 210\).
     - Costs involve congestion at segment O-L and a fixed cost for L-D.

   - **Route O-L-R-D:**
     - Travel Cost = \(10X + 0 + 10Y\).
     - Costs involve congestion at both segments O-L and R-D, but no fixed cost between L and R.

   - **Route O-R-D:**
     - Travel Cost = \(210 + 10Y\).
     - Fixed cost for O-R and congestion cost for R-D.

2. **Analysis Based on Player Behavior:**
    - **Route O-L-D** and **O-L-R-D** share the initial segment (O-L), so decisions on these routes are linked.
    - Many players could be attracted to the perceived cheaper O-L-R-D if they expect lower traffic through no fixed cost on L-R.
    - Often, the players’ choices will aim to minimize their expected congestion and fixed costs.

3. **Predicting Player Distribution:**
    - If most players choose O-R-D due to its fixed start and less dependency on player choice, expect significant congestion there.
    - Anti-cyclic behavior might suggest a switch by players seeking to avoid heavy costs in previous rounds, especially if O-R-D was congested.

4. **Strategic Route Selection:**
    - Attempt to choose a route less likely to be crowded based on previous congestion balances.
    - Avoid routes with historical high congestion unless it’s evident players dramatically shifted away.

5. **Decision Consideration:**
    - **O-L-D**: Large congestion can lead to higher costs even with spread out players on O-L.
    - **O-L-R-D** might attract fewer due to its less predictable nature; benefit lies in lower expected costs if O-L segment can be minimally congested.
    - **O-R-D**: Reliable but prone to congestion if too many players shift here seeking the most stable cost scenario.

Given these points, an approach would be to evaluate the least likely congested route based on anticipated player reaction.

Given a significant shift toward expecting congestion in O-R-D and O-L being reasonably distributed, I would choose:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a strategic decision for this round, let's evaluate the previous round's outcomes and consider potential player behavior:

1. **Review of Last Round’s Results:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** 0 players chose this route.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** 16 players chose this route.
   - **Route O-R-D:** 2 players chose this route.
   - Your payoff was 60 points, indicating a high travel cost due to congestion on O-L-R-D.

2. **Cost Calculation Insights:**
   - For **O-L-D**: No players chose this last round, so it wasn't congested.
   - For **O-L-R-D**: Extreme congestion due to 16 players choosing it, making it costly.
   - For **O-R-D**: Minimal congestion with only 2 players, likely making it more economical.

3. **Analysis of Player Behavior:**
   - Many players flocked to O-L-R-D, likely anticipating it as a balanced cost option, but it resulted in high congestion.
   - Few players chose O-L-D, likely due to expectations of higher costs without immediate insight.

4. **Predicting Player Movement for This Round:**
   - Players on the congested O-L-R-D will likely switch to either O-L-D or O-R-D seeking lower costs.
   - With no congestion last round on O-L-D, some players are likely to consider it for lower costs.
   - O-R-D, with its consistent cost structure and minimal congestion last round, might attract more players who want to minimize expected costs.

5. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - **O-L-D:** Could see an increase in players but was empty last round, making it a potentially good choice if many players switch from O-L-R-D.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Likely to see reduced numbers as many players experienced high costs.
   - **O-R-D:** May attract more due to the previously low congestion but predict overflow if too many switch.

6. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Avoid where congestion was high but don’t converge on routes likely to be the new hot spot (balance strategy).
   - Consider player migration trends and the likelihood of others avoiding last round's heavy cost routes.

Based on these considerations, and predicting that players will move away from a congested O-L-R-D and possibly fill O-R-D, selecting O-L-D might provide a lower-cost travel option if it remains less congested.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 13, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 5}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a strategic decision for the next round, let's analyze the past round's results and predict player behaviors based on those results:

1. **Review of Last Round’s Results:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** 13 players chose this route.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** 0 players chose this route.
   - **Route O-R-D:** 5 players chose this route.
   - Your payoff was 60 points, indicating high costs due to congestion on O-L-D.

2. **Cost Calculation Insights:**
   - **O-L-D:** High congestion due to 13 players, making it costly.
   - **O-L-R-D:** No players meant no cost; might become attractive as it was completely unused.
   - **O-R-D:** Moderate congestion with 5 players, potentially offering balanced costs last round.

3. **Analysis of Player Behavior:**
   - A majority chose O-L-D, possibly expecting lower costs, which didn't bear fruit due to high congestion.
   - The lack of players on O-L-R-D likely kept its costs low, potentially attracting attention this round.
   - O-R-D had moderate usage, suggesting a potential sweet spot for cost-conscious players.

4. **Predicting Player Movement for This Round:**
   - Players deterred by O-L-D's high cost might look to switch to any alternative that promises less congestion.
   - O-L-R-D might attract players now because it was empty last round, potentially promising lower costs.
   - O-R-D may maintain or increase numbers as it might seem like a safer bet than the overcrowded O-L-D.

5. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - **O-L-D:** Likely to see reduced numbers; players may avoid its high costs.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Could become popular due to zero congestion last round, presenting a risk of new congestion.
   - **O-R-D:** Might remain stable or see increased numbers as others look for a less crowded option.

6. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Aim to choose a route that had lower congestion last time but isn't necessarily at risk for a sudden influx.
   - Predict where players might not move in large numbers based on cost experiences.

Considering the potential for players to avoid O-L-D after its high congestion, while others may overreact to fill O-L-R-D anticipating no congestion, you might continue with O-R-D for its balance and predictability.

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a strategic decision for this round, let's analyze the outcomes from the last round and project potential player behavior:

1. **Review of Last Round’s Results:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** 0 players chose this route.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** 15 players chose this route.
   - **Route O-R-D:** 3 players chose this route.
   - Your payoff was 10 points, indicating very high costs due to significant congestion on O-L-R-D.

2. **Cost Calculation Insights:**
   - **O-L-D:** No players meant no congestion and could have been the least costly.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Extremely congested with 15 players, resulting in high costs.
   - **O-R-D:** Low congestion with only 3 players, likely offering a moderate cost structure.

3. **Analysis of Player Behavior:**
   - The majority choosing O-L-R-D indicates a strong preference last round, probably due to expectations of balanced costs, leading to congestion.
   - O-L-D being completely unused might attract players as a potential cost-saving choice.
   - O-R-D, maintaining a small number of players, might continue to attract those seeking stable costs.

4. **Predicting Player Movement for This Round:**
   - Players dissatisfied with high costs from O-L-R-D might switch to avoid congestion.
   - O-L-D might become an attractive option this round, given it wasn't used at all last time.
   - O-R-D remains a potential choice for players seeking minimal congestion if others continue to ignore it.

5. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - **O-L-D:** Could see increased interest due to zero use last round, potentially filling up.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Likely to see a decrease in players as they look to avoid high costs.
   - **O-R-D:** May remain stable if players seek predictability, potentially offset by new shifts to O-L-D.

6. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Consider the likelihood of players switching based on their last experience and pick the route that might not get overwhelmed.
   - Predict which route will have lower player count based on behavioral trends and past congestion.

Given these considerations, and anticipating a potential shift to O-L-D by players seeking to avoid past congestions, selecting Route 'O-R-D' might again be strategic if it remains less congested and offers stability.

Your payoff was 170

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To optimize your decision for the upcoming round, we should analyze previous results and anticipate potential player reactions:

1. **Review of Last Round’s Results:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** 16 players chose this route.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** 0 players chose this route.
   - **Route O-R-D:** 2 players chose this route.
   - Your payoff was 170 points, indicating a relatively low cost due to minimal competition on your chosen route.

2. **Cost Calculation Insights:**
   - **O-L-D:** Extremely congested, leading to high travel costs as 16 players chose it.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Completely unused, hence no congestion costs and therefore could be cost-efficient if chosen correctly.
   - **O-R-D:** Minimal congestion with only 2 players, resulting in favorable costs.

3. **Analysis of Player Behavior:**
   - The majority choosing O-L-D might have been expecting a balanced cost, leading to heavy congestion.
   - O-L-R-D not being used makes it a potentially attractive option for players avoiding congestion.
   - O-R-D, with minimal congestion, remains a predictably low-cost option.

4. **Predicting Player Movement for This Round:**
   - Players on the congested O-L-D might switch to reduce costs and may consider O-L-R-D due to its complete absence of players last round.
   - O-L-R-D could attract more players seeking a less congested route.
   - O-R-D might continue to attract those looking for stable costs, but potentially seeing an increase if many desert O-L-D.

5. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - **O-L-D:** Likely to experience diminished interest as players avoid its high past congestion.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Could become a popular choice, especially if players look to capitalize on its non-usage.
   - **O-R-D:** Remains potentially stable but might see increased interest due to its low-cost nature.

6. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Decide based on where fewer players might lean towards, considering last round’s congestion trends and player adjustments.

Given these considerations and anticipating a player shift towards the previously unused O-L-R-D, you might select O-R-D again for its consistent lower congestion if it attracts fewer new pickers.

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 12, 'O-R-D': 6}
Your payoff was 10

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision for the upcoming round, let's analyze the previous outcomes and project potential player behaviors:

1. **Review of Last Round’s Results:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** 0 players chose this route, indicating no congestion and potentially low costs.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** 12 players chose this route, leading to significant congestion.
   - **Route O-R-D:** 6 players chose this route, resulting in moderate congestion.
   - Your payoff was 10 points, indicating you experienced high costs, likely from selecting a route with substantial congestion.

2. **Cost Calculation Insights:**
   - **O-L-D:** As it was unused, choosing it could have resulted in minimal costs.
   - **O-L-R-D:** With 12 players, congestion likely led to high costs due to shared congestion.
   - **O-R-D:** A moderate number of players would mean relatively more balanced costs.

3. **Analysis of Player Behavior:**
   - O-L-D remaining unused might now draw attention due to its cost-saving potential.
   - High numbers on O-L-R-D suggest players were trying to optimize travel paths but led to friction.
   - O-R-D’s moderate use shows it as the middle-ground choice but could attract players moving from O-L-R-D.

4. **Predicting Player Movement for This Round:**
   - Players on the highly congested O-L-R-D are likely to switch to avoid past round costs, potentially to O-L-D or O-R-D.
   - O-L-D might see interest due to its non-usage and cost-saving potential.
   - O-R-D could attract players seeking a predictable cost structure, despite moderate congestion last round. 

5. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - **O-L-D:** Given no players, it offers high potential for low costs, but risks becoming crowded if overestimated.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Likely to see reduced players as costs were high.
   - **O-R-D:** If players perceive it as less desirable than O-L-D, it may maintain or reduce user count.

6. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Choose the route expected to have fewer players, balancing the trend towards known low-cost but potentially avoiding perceived overcrowding.

Considering these dynamics and likely shifts of players trying to avoid congestion, a shift towards O-L-D could occur. Trying O-L-D could be strategic if players over-adjust away from it, but if you're hedging, O-L-R-D has been decreasing in interest and may present low competition again.

Your payoff was 10

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's carefully consider the results from the previous round and think strategically about what might happen in this round:

1. **Review of Last Round’s Results:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** 18 players chose this route, leading to complete congestion.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** 0 players chose this route, meaning no congestion.
   - **Route O-R-D:** 0 players chose this route, also meaning no congestion.
   - Your payoff was 10 points, indicating you were on the heavily congested route O-L-D resulting in very high costs.

2. **Cost Calculation Insights:**
   - **O-L-D:** Total congestion with 18 players led to exorbitant costs.
   - **O-L-R-D and O-R-D:** Both routes were completely unused, indicating zero congestion and potential for minimum costs if chosen.

3. **Analysis of Player Behavior:**
   - Many players likely chose O-L-D expecting a more balanced cost distribution, which backfired heavily.
   - O-L-R-D and O-R-D might become attractive options due to their lack of usage and hence lower costs.

4. **Predicting Player Movement for This Round:**
   - It's likely that no players will repeat on O-L-D given its high cost, so shifts are expected towards O-L-R-D or O-R-D.
   - O-L-R-D might appear attractive for those anticipating others will avoid high congestion routes.
   - O-R-D should also be attractive given its previous underuse, but could attract cautious players seeking steady costs.

5. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - **O-L-D:** Likely to become unpopular due to last round’s high congestion.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Possible increase in players, as it was seen as a clearly avoided route before but might get inundated if too many flocking.
   - **O-R-D:** Similarly may see increased numbers, but could remain a lower-risk if others anticipate heavier shifts to O-L-R-D.

6. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Choose the route that both optimizes cost expectations and anticipates fewer players based on anticipated behavioral shifts.

Given these considerations, and predicting an expected shift away from O-L-D by players seeking to avoid repeated high costs, both O-L-R-D and O-R-D present opportunities. However, to avoid crowding risk as players opt away from extremes, selecting O-R-D might be strategic, offering potential for balanced player distribution without sudden over-correction.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a strategic decision for the current round, let’s analyze the previous round’s outcomes and potential player behaviors:

1. **Review of Last Round’s Results:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** 0 players chose this route, indicating no congestion and a potential for low costs if selected.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** 7 players chose this route, suggesting moderate congestion.
   - **Route O-R-D:** 11 players chose this route, indicating higher congestion and possibly elevated costs.
   - Your payoff was 10 points, indicating high costs, probably from selecting a more congested route.

2. **Cost Calculation Insights:**
   - **O-L-D:** Not used, representing a potential low-cost choice due to no congestion.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Moderate usage, with costs being considerable due to moderate congestion.
   - **O-R-D:** Heavily used with likely higher costs because of heavier congestion.

3. **Analysis of Player Behavior:**
   - Players might have avoided O-L-D expecting others to do the same, leading to an opportunity for low-cost routing.
   - Many players chose O-R-D, potentially seeing it as a stable choice, yet suffered due to congestion.
   - O-L-R-D could have been appealing due to its middle-of-the-road cost expectation but also ended up congested.

4. **Predicting Player Movement for This Round:**
   - Players on O-R-D might look for alternatives owing to high costs, potentially considering O-L-D for its complete lack of congestion.
   - O-L-R-D might stabilize or decline as players react to past round congestion.
   - O-L-D could become more attractive due to its zero congestion last round, attracting those seeking significant cost reductions.

5. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - **O-L-D:** Could gain interest after being completely ignored last round, leading to potential moderate congestion.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Might see stable participants, or a reduction if players are shifting strategies.
   - **O-R-D:** Could see declining numbers as players avoid repeating high costs.

6. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Choose the route expected to have fewer players, while balancing the potential influx based on observed patterns.

Taking into account these factors and predicting that players will avoid the more heavily congested O-R-D and might consider a shift back towards O-L-D due to its zero use and potential low cost, selecting O-L-R-D may again be a strategic choice if it stabilizes without attracting excess players escaping the extremes.

   - **Route O-L-R-D:** 2 players chose this route, indicating minimal congestion.
   - **Route O-R-D:** 0 players chose this route, meaning no congestion and potentially the least cost.
   - Your payoff was 200 points, indicating you chose a route with minimal costs relative to others.

2. **Cost Calculation Insights:**
   - **O-L-D:** Highly congested with 16 players, leading to high costs.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Minimal congestion with just 2 players, making it cost-effective last round.
   - **O-R-D:** Completely unused, suggesting a potential for extremely low costs if selected.

3. **Analysis of Player Behavior:**
   - Many players likely expected O-L-D to be distributed with moderate costs but resulted in high congestion.
   - O-L-R-D attracted minimal players, thus improving cost-effectiveness.
   - O-R-D being completely empty opens opportunities for low-cost travel as players look for shifts.

4. **Predicting Player Movement for This Round:**
   - Players burdened by high costs on O-L-D might shift away, likely towards O-L-R-D or O-R-D.
   - O-R-D’s complete lack of players last round could make it an attractive target for players seeking the least congested route.
   - O-L-R-D might continue to attract those seeking a middle ground between the extremes.

5. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - **O-L-D:** Likely to be less favored as players shift to avoid congestion.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Could maintain interest as a balance but may risk a slight increase in users.
   - **O-R-D:** Likely to see increased interest as it offers predictably low costs from zero usage last round.

6. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Aim to choose a route with the anticipated lower player count while balancing the possible shifts in strategy and congestion.

Based on these considerations and the expectation that many players will move towards O-R-D due to very low previous use, potentially making it more crowded, selecting O-L-R-D might continue to provide a balanced choice, combining moderate interest and predictability.

AI: To make a smart decision for this round, let's review the previous results and anticipate player behavior strategically:

1. **Review of Last Round’s Results:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** 0 players chose this route, indicating no congestion and low costs.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** 1 player chose this route, indicating minimal congestion with low costs.
   - **Route O-R-D:** 17 players chose this route, leading to significant congestion and likely higher costs despite its simplicity.
   - Your payoff was 210 points, suggesting you likely chose an optimal route with minimal congestion.

2. **Cost Calculation Insights:**
   - **O-L-D:** No usage implies potential for minimal costs.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Very lightly used with 1 player, making it another low-cost choice.
   - **O-R-D:** Very congested, likely resulting in high costs for the players involved.

3. **Analysis of Player Behavior:**
   - Mass exodus to O-R-D indicates players were seeking predictable or balanced costs but led to congestion.
   - O-L-D and O-L-R-D both had low usage last round, indicating opportunities if chosen conservatively.

4. **Predicting Player Movement for This Round:**
   - Players dissuaded by high costs on O-R-D might now switch to O-L-D or O-L-R-D, likely searching less congested alternatives.
   - O-L-D, having been completely unused, might attract those looking at it as the least likely congested path this round.
   - O-L-R-D might continue to attract those willing to balance any over-shifts from O-R-D.

5. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - **O-L-D:** Could gain attention due to non-use, but risks becoming crowded if many switch.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Might maintain moderate interest or increase slightly but potentially remain balanced.
   - **O-R-D:** Likely to see a reduction in players, who may anticipated shifts towards less crowded routes.

6. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Evaluate the likelihood of shifts away from heavily congested areas while leveraging the open paths that may balance out.

Based on these assessments, anticipating a move away from O-R-D due to its high congestion last round, choosing either O-L-D or O-L-R-D appears attractive. Given that O-L-D was completely unused previously, trying O-L-D might be strategic, presuming not all will rush to it.

   - **O-L-D:** Expected to be less favored due to high congestion from the last round.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Might draw interest as it offers some breathing room from congestion, but could risk becoming crowded.
   - **O-R-D:** Expected to stay appealing due to its stable low-cost pattern unless large shifts occur.

6. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Choose a route where fewer players are likely to go, maximizing the potential for minimal congestion and cost.

Considering these insights and anticipating movements away from the high congestion of O-L-D, selecting O-L-R-D may provide substantial opportunity if players are tempered in their shift. If you anticipate stability, O-R-D remains a credible choice for managing congestion and cost.

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 12, 'O-R-D': 6}
Your payoff was 100

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision for this round, let's thoroughly review last round's outcomes and explore potential player behavior:

1. **Review of Last Round’s Results:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** 0 players chose this route, indicating no congestion and offering potential minimal costs.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** 12 players selected this route, resulting in significant congestion and higher costs.
   - **Route O-R-D:** 6 players chose this route, indicating moderate congestion.
   - Your payoff was 100 points, suggesting moderate costs likely due to congestion.

2. **Cost Calculation Insights:**
   - **O-L-D:** Unused, providing a strong potential for low costs if chosen without overcrowding.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Heavily congested with 12 players, leading to increased costs.
   - **O-R-D:** Moderately used, offering relatively balanced costs compared to O-L-R-D.

3. **Analysis of Player Behavior:**
   - O-L-D having zero players might attract those looking to avoid congestion and seek minimal costs.
   - Heavy congestion on O-L-R-D indicates players might seek alternatives, expecting others to potentially follow.
   - O-R-D suggests a more stable preference, yet may become a fallback choice if shifts occur significantly.

4. **Predicting Player Movement for This Round:**
   - Players experiencing high costs on O-L-R-D may move to O-L-D seeking a zero-congestion route.
   - O-L-D could garner interest due to non-use, but risks congestion if too many choose it simultaneously.
   - O-R-D might still appeal to players seeking predictability unless shifts grow too concentrated.

5. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - **O-L-D:** Likely to attract interest due to its capacity for cost savings but may risk overcrowding.
   - **O-L-R-D:** May lose some participants due to congestion in the last round.
   - **O-R-D:** Could remain stable if treated as a middle-ground choice without overcrowding.

6. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Opt for the route anticipated to carry fewer players, balancing expected shifts and historical congestion patterns.

Given these insights, and anticipating potential shifts towards O-L-D due to its zero use, consider O-R-D for a stable, balanced choice to avoid large shifts while maintaining consistent costs.
