System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an optimal decision on which route to choose between 'O-L-D' and 'O-R-D', let's break down the decision process step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Cost Structure**:
   - Route 'O-L-D' has a cost of `10 * X + 210`, where `X` is the number of drivers choosing segment 'O-L'.
   - Route 'O-R-D' has a cost of `210 + 10 * Y`, where `Y` is the number of drivers choosing segment 'R-D'.

2. **Initial Endowment**: You start each round with 400 points. The goal is to minimize the travel cost to maximize the remaining points.

3. **Analyze Costs**:
   - The cost for 'O-L-D' increases with more drivers on segment 'O-L', starting at 220 when you're the only one on this route (i.e., `X = 1`).
   - The cost for 'O-R-D' increases with more drivers on segment 'R-D', starting at 220 when you're the only one on this route (i.e., `Y = 1`).

4. **Consider Other Drivers' Choices**:
   - If more drivers choose 'O-L-D', its cost increases, making 'O-R-D' potentially more appealing if it remains less crowded.
   - Conversely, if more drivers choose 'O-R-D', the cost for that route increases, potentially making 'O-L-D' the better option if fewer drivers choose it.

5. **Strategic Decision**:
   - Since all drivers aim to minimize costs, they may try to balance between the routes.
   - Historically (or assuming prior behavior), you might expect an even distribution initially. However, drivers may adjust based on past rounds' outcomes.
   - If, in previous rounds, you noticed a pattern of many drivers choosing 'O-L-D', you might anticipate less traffic on 'O-R-D' in the next round, and vice versa.

6. **Choose the Route**:
   - Given the symmetric nature of the problem and assuming no prior specific trend, a starting strategy could be to choose randomly or based on slight inclinations from past rounds.
   - If you have specific insights (e.g., recent observations about more traffic on one route), leverage that.

For this example (without additional historical pattern data), a balanced approach might be simply to alternate or begin by choosing one of the routes, especially if the past rounds do not give clear indicators of overcrowding on one.

Let's choose 'O-L-D' to start, assuming no prior dominant strategy is apparent without leaning towards one due to alternating strategy convenience.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 7, 'O-R-D': 11}
Your payoff was 120

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the information from the last round and aiming to make a more informed decision, let's re-evaluate the situation:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 7 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 11 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 120 points.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 7 + 210 = 280 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 11 = 320 points`.
   - Last round, if you chose 'O-R-D' based on your payoff of 120 (400 - 280), it seems you actually chose 'O-L-D'.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-R-D' was costlier due to more drivers, which made your choice of 'O-L-D' a relatively better one last round.
   - If the distribution remains similar, choosing 'O-L-D' again could continue to provide a lower cost compared to 'O-R-D'.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - Other drivers might notice that 'O-R-D' was more costly and decide to switch to 'O-L-D', increasing traffic there.
   - Some drivers on 'O-L-D' might stick with their choice if they had a better payoff compared to 'O-R-D'.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Given the prior reliable outcome with 'O-L-D', you might opt to continue with 'O-L-D', assuming not all drivers will switch away from 'O-R-D'.
   - If too many switch, the cost will rise; however, the risk is that both routes may reach a similar high cost if distribution evens out.

6. **Decision**:
   - Since last round resulted in a favorable outcome and considering the herd mentality where not all drivers change immediately, a prudent decision is to choose 'O-L-D' again this round.

Therefore, the chosen strategy for this round is to stay on 'O-L-D', to potentially maintain a lower cost if driver distribution remains relatively favorable.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 14, 'O-R-D': 4}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the situation and make a more informed decision based on the latest update:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 14 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 4 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 50 points.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 14 + 210 = 350 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 4 = 250 points`.
   - Your payoff of 50 points indicates you were on 'O-L-D', which was significantly more crowded and costly.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-L-D' became highly crowded, driving the costs up.
   - 'O-R-D' was less crowded and consequently had a lower travel cost.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - Drivers who chose 'O-L-D' will likely notice their high costs and consider switching to 'O-R-D'.
   - Assuming rational behavior, some of the 14 drivers from 'O-L-D' will switch to 'O-R-D' to capitalize on its lower costs.
   - Consequently, 'O-R-D' might receive a few more drivers, but the cost could still be more favorable compared to the overcrowded 'O-L-D'.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Given the high congestion on 'O-L-D', switching to 'O-R-D', which has fewer drivers, is a good strategy if seeking a lower cost.
   - 'O-R-D' currently offers a more favorable cost, and with expected redistribution, it might still remain advantageous.

6. **Decision**:
   - Opt for 'O-R-D' to potentially benefit from a lower travel cost, as others from 'O-L-D' might not all switch in one round, keeping 'O-R-D' relatively low in congestion.

Based on this analysis, choose route 'O-R-D' for this round.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 4, 'O-R-D': 14}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's evaluate the current situation carefully to make a well-informed decision for the next round:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 4 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 14 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 50 points.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 4 + 210 = 250 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 14 = 350 points`.
   - Your low payoff indicates you chose 'O-R-D', which had become crowded and thus costly.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-R-D' became highly congested, causing the cost to rise significantly.
   - 'O-L-D', with fewer drivers, offered a lower travel cost last round.
   
4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - Drivers who experienced high costs on 'O-R-D' will likely consider switching to the less congested 'O-L-D'.
   - It's reasonable to predict a shift of some drivers from 'O-R-D' to 'O-L-D'.
   - However, the current number of drivers on 'O-R-D' suggests it might still remain more crowded.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Based on the current rotation dynamics, shifting to 'O-L-D' might yield a lower cost, anticipating that not all 14 drivers on 'O-R-D' will switch immediately.
   - Monitoring such patterns can maximize the chances of moving to a less crowded route offering better payoffs.

6. **Decision**:
   - Given the current trend, choosing 'O-L-D' is a strategic move to leverage its current lower congestion and potential lower cost.

Therefore, the decision is to switch to route 'O-L-D' for the next round.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the current scenario and make an informed decision for the next round:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 15 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 3 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 40 points.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 15 + 210 = 360 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 3 = 240 points`.
   - Your low payoff indicates you chose 'O-L-D', which was very crowded and resulted in a high cost.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-L-D' became highly congested, pushing the cost up.
   - 'O-R-D', with only 3 drivers, was the cheaper option last round.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - Many drivers who experienced high costs on 'O-L-D' are likely to switch to 'O-R-D', which had significantly lower costs.
   - This switch could lead to 'O-R-D' becoming more congested in the next round, but currently, it seems like the better choice given the existing distribution.
   
5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - The likelihood of overcrowding is now higher on 'O-L-D' given driver dissatisfaction with high costs, making 'O-R-D' potentially a better current strategy.
   - Switching to 'O-R-D' should be advantageous if we anticipate drivers will redistribute significantly away from 'O-L-D'.

6. **Decision**:
   - Choosing 'O-R-D' is sensible as it was less crowded last round, and many drivers may switch to it after observing the high congestion on 'O-L-D'.

The decision is to opt for route 'O-R-D' for this round, expecting it to offer lower costs due to less congestion.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's approach the decision systematically, given the information and past trends:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 3 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 15 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 40 points.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 3 + 210 = 240 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 15 = 360 points`.
   - The low payoff indicates you chose 'O-R-D', which was heavily congested and costly.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-R-D' attracted a high number of drivers, leading to increased congestion and higher costs.
   - 'O-L-D', with only 3 drivers, offered a much lower cost.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - It's highly likely drivers will recognize the high cost of 'O-R-D' from the last round and will switch back to 'O-L-D'.
   - This change could lead to 'O-L-D' becoming slightly more crowded, but it might still remain more economical if not all 15 drivers switch at once.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Switching to 'O-L-D' is the logical choice as it offered significantly lower costs.
   - It's expected that some drivers will transfer to 'O-L-D' for lower costs, but given the imbalance, it should still be the preferable route.

6. **Decision**:
   - Opt for 'O-L-D', as it was underutilized and thus cheaper in the last round, and predict the redistribution will not overcrowd it immediately.

Therefore, the prudent choice is to choose route 'O-L-D' for this next round.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's take a strategic approach based on the pattern we are observing to make a well-informed decision:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 15 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 3 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 40 points, indicating you were on 'O-L-D', which was heavily crowded and thus costly.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 15 + 210 = 360 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 3 = 240 points`.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-L-D' is highly congested, leading to high costs.
   - 'O-R-D' was far less congested and offered a lower cost last round.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - Given the high cost on 'O-L-D', it is likely that many drivers will switch to 'O-R-D' to benefit from its lower costs.
   - There could be a significant shift in drivers from 'O-L-D' to 'O-R-D', as they seek to avoid the high congestion experienced last round.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Switching to 'O-R-D' is advisable, as it is currently underutilized and offers a more favorable cost if fewer drivers remain.
   - While there may be a switch, it's unlikely that all 15 drivers will move at once, potentially keeping 'O-R-D' still advantageous.

6. **Decision**:
   - Opt for 'O-R-D', as the lower congestion pattern suggests a reduced cost, and many other drivers might not switch immediately, making it a less risky choice.

To adapt strategically, the recommended choice this round is to select route 'O-R-D'.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the fluctuations in the choices of routes over recent rounds, let's carefully plan the decision-making process for this upcoming round:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 3 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 15 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 40 points, indicating that you chose 'O-R-D', which was overcrowded.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 3 + 210 = 240 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 15 = 360 points`.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-R-D' was significantly congested and resulted in high costs.
   - 'O-L-D', with only 3 drivers, was a much cheaper option.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - Observing these trends, many drivers from 'O-R-D' will likely switch to 'O-L-D' to avoid the high costs.
   - However, historical patterns suggest there may be a delay or reluctance for all drivers to switch immediately, making 'O-L-D' potentially advantageous still in the short term.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Given this pattern, it may be strategic to switch to 'O-L-D', anticipating that it will still have fewer drivers initially.
   - It's reasonable to expect that not all drivers will switch routes simultaneously, keeping 'O-L-D' sufficiently less crowded.

6. **Decision**:
   - Choose 'O-L-D', leveraging the expectation that some drivers remain on 'O-R-D' and hoping 'O-L-D' stays less congested than 'O-R-D'.

Therefore, the decision for this next round is to select route 'O-L-D', expecting it to offer a lower cost due to reduced congestion.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a strategic decision for the next round, let's carefully analyze the pattern, considering the latest result and trends:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 16 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 2 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 30 points, indicating you chose 'O-L-D', which was overcrowded and, therefore, very costly.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 16 + 210 = 370 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 2 = 230 points`.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-L-D' became extremely congested, leading to high costs.
   - 'O-R-D', with only 2 drivers, had a relatively low cost.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - Given the extraordinarily high cost on 'O-L-D', many drivers are likely to switch to 'O-R-D' in the next round to reduce their costs.
   - However, not everyone may switch immediately, and drivers may expect some will remain, thus trying to balance choices.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Switching to 'O-R-D' is advisable, as it had significantly lower costs last round.
   - It's expected that many drivers from 'O-L-D' will move to 'O-R-D', but starting with much lower congestion means 'O-R-D' is likely still the better option next round.

6. **Decision**:
   - Opt for 'O-R-D', anticipating a better payoff due to lower congestion based on the last round's experiences.

Based on the analysis, the strategic decision is to choose route 'O-R-D'.

```json

   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 17 = 380 points`.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-R-D' became highly congested, which led to very high costs.
   - 'O-L-D', with only 1 driver, offered the lowest potential cost.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - Given the excessive cost of 'O-R-D', it is highly likely that a large number of drivers will switch to 'O-L-D' to minimize costs.
   - Conversely, a much smaller number on 'O-L-D' indicates it was significantly underutilized.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Switching to 'O-L-D' is the logical choice given its drastically lower cost last round.
   - While some drivers will likely switch, it's improbable that all 17 drivers will move to 'O-L-D' immediately, maintaining a relatively lower cost there.

6. **Decision**:
   - Select 'O-L-D', expecting it to still offer a lower cost due to the lower initial congestion and profitability.

Based on the analysis, the decision is to choose route 'O-L-D'.

```json

```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 17, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To strategically decide for the upcoming round, let's break down the current situation:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 17 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 1 driver chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 20 points, indicating you chose 'O-L-D', which was very crowded and costly.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 17 + 210 = 380 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 1 = 220 points`.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-L-D' was extremely overcrowded, resulting in high costs.
   - 'O-R-D', with only 1 driver, was the significantly cheaper route.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - With such a high cost on 'O-L-D', a substantial number of drivers are likely to switch to 'O-R-D' in search of lower costs.
   - 'O-R-D' had much lower congestion, making it the preferable route.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Switching to 'O-R-D' is advisable, as its cost was substantially lower last round.
   - There is usually a balancing act as drivers redistribute, but it is unlikely that all 17 drivers will switch to 'O-R-D' at once.

6. **Decision**:
   - Choose 'O-R-D', as it was underutilized last round and should remain more cost-effective if even a moderate switch occurs.

Therefore, the decision for this round is to choose route 'O-R-D'.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 1, 'O-R-D': 17}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's review the recent dynamics and decide strategically for the upcoming round:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 1 driver chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 17 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 20 points, indicating you chose 'O-R-D', which was extremely congested and costly.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 1 + 210 = 220 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 17 = 380 points`.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-R-D' has been severely overcrowded, causing high penalties in cost.
   - 'O-L-D', having only 1 driver, offered a much more economical choice.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - Given the consistently high cost and congestion on 'O-R-D', many drivers will likely switch to 'O-L-D' to seek lower costs.
   - Although some drivers may switch, it's improbable all will move simultaneously, leaving 'O-R-D' less crowded this round.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Switching to 'O-L-D' is a high-probability choice for a lower cost, as it was much cheaper last round.
   - With overly high congestion currently on 'O-R-D', drivers generally tend to spread out in subsequent rounds.

6. **Decision**:
   - Select 'O-L-D', anticipating a better payoff resulting from its lower congestion and therefore cost.

Based on this analysis, the decision is to select route 'O-L-D' for this round. 

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 2, 'O-R-D': 16}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's carefully evaluate the situation and make a strategic choice for this round based on past patterns:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 2 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 16 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 30 points, indicating you chose 'O-R-D', which was highly congested.

2. **Calculate Last Round Costs**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 2 + 210 = 230 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 16 = 370 points`.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-R-D' was heavily congested, leading to very high costs.
   - 'O-L-D', with much fewer drivers, offered a much lower cost.

4. **Predict Next Round**:
   - Given the disproportionate congestion and cost on 'O-R-D', many drivers are likely to switch to 'O-L-D' to minimize their costs.
   - While it's plausible that many will switch, not all 16 drivers will move instantly, potentially keeping 'O-L-D' favorable.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Switching to 'O-L-D' is logical given its much lower observed congestion and cost.
   - Anticipate some drivers shifting, but 'O-L-D' should still present a better option compared to the heavily crowded 'O-R-D'.

6. **Decision**:
   - Choose 'O-L-D', predicting lower congestion and thus better payoff due to it being less utilized in the last round.

Based on this analysis, the recommended decision is to select route 'O-L-D' for the current round.

System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a strategic decision, let's systematically consider the options and analyze potential outcomes, given the new option in the route choices:

1. **Understanding the Cost Structure**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: Cost is `10X + 210`, where `X` is the number of drivers using segment O-L.
   - **Route 'O-L-R-D'**: Cost is `10X + 10Y`, where `X` is for segment O-L and `Y` is for segment R-D.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: Cost is `210 + 10Y`, where `Y` is the number of drivers using segment R-D.

2. **Analyze each route**:
   - **'O-L-D'**: Has a fixed cost on L-D. If fewer drivers choose this, it might be economical, but if it becomes crowded, costs rise due to the O-L segment.
   - **'O-L-R-D'**: Use this if both segments O-L and R-D are lightly trafficked; the additional flexibility might minimize cost by avoiding heavy segments.
   - **'O-R-D'**: This has a fixed cost on O-R and a variable cost on R-D. If few drivers choose this segment, it could be less costly.

3. **Consider Player Distribution**:
   - If players tend to avoid routes that were costly last round, they may gravitate towards options perceived as less busy.
   - A pattern might be forming where too many switch from previously costly routes to less costly ones, reversing the situation.

4. **Strategic Thoughts**:
   - Anticipate where drivers might least likely shift. If many jump to 'O-R-D' thinking 'O-L' will be crowded, 'O-L-R-D' might split the difference effectively.
   - Past behavior of drivers can help gauge shifts, but balancing between extremes ('O-L-D' vs 'O-R-D') using 'O-L-R-D' dynamically covers spread.

5. **Decision**:
   - Choose a route based on expected driver distribution and cost efficiency.
   - Since both segments need to be balanced, 'O-L-R-D' offers avoidance if either segment is heavily loaded; this route benefits particularly if O-L or R-D starts loading more congestion.

Given the analysis, a strategic decision would be to select the route 'O-L-R-D' as a balanced choice, taking advantage of its flexibility in managing congestion.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision, let's analyze the results from the last round and consider each route option:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 0 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-L-R-D'**: 16 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 2 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 60 points, indicating you likely chose 'O-L-R-D', which was crowded.

2. **Cost Analysis from Last Round**:
   - For 'O-L-D': Since no drivers used this route, it had 0 cost attributed to additional drivers, with the minimum cost being 210 for L-D.
   - For 'O-L-R-D': The cost was `10 * 16 (O-L segment) + 10 * 18 (R-D segment) = 160 + 180 = 340`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 16 = 370` due to high traffic on R-D.

3. **Route Characteristics**:
   - **'O-L-D'**: If no one is using this, the cost remains only the fixed segment cost. Ideal if all shift away as it is unused.
   - **'O-L-R-D'**: Was costly due to high driver count, especially due to segment R-D congestion.
   - **'O-R-D'**: If fewer use it, very economical; ideal if the R-D segment is underused again.

4. **Implications and Predictions**:
   - Given the past overcrowding, many may avoid 'O-L-R-D' this round.
   - 'O-L-D' was not chosen at all; thus it could be very economical if others switch away.
   - Based on its past under-use, 'O-R-D' might be more attractive, yet risky if too many shift to it.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - 'O-L-D' seems quite promising as it went unused (no dynamic component), potentially low cost if traffic switches away.
   - 'O-L-R-D' may still bear high costs despite its flexibility owing to propensity for congestive routing twice.

6. **Decision**:
   - Given these observations and the fact that other drivers might spread out more evenly now, 'O-L-D' offers a low-cost potential round.

Based on this thorough evaluation, the selected route for this round is 'O-L-D', taking a strategic risk that others will avoid this path due to last round's pattern.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 13, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 5}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To determine the optimal route for the upcoming round, we need to analyze the results of the last round and consider potential implications for this round:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 13 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-L-R-D'**: 0 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 5 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 60 points, suggesting you likely chose 'O-L-D', which had substantial but not extreme congestion.

2. **Cost Analysis from Last Round**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 13 + 210 = 130 + 210 = 340 points`.
   - For 'O-L-R-D': Went unused, so theoretically cost could have been based on shared segments but not applicable here.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 5 = 260 points`, showing less congestion on R-D.

3. **Route Characteristics**:
   - **'O-L-D'**: Crowd pressure last round might lead to shifts away, raising or lowering its appeal based on calculations.
   - **'O-L-R-D'**: Was unused, suggesting a balanced potential option if others switch or distribute evenly.
   - **'O-R-D'**: Less crowded last round but could attract new switchers from 'O-L-D' leading to balanced risk.

4. **Strategic Insights**:
   - Trends suggest incumbents may move from high congestion zone 'O-L-D'.
   - Drivers might look to 'O-L-R-D' for medium congestion strategies since it was completely avoided.

5. **Predicted Shifts**:
   - 'O-L-R-D' might be advantageous given its complete avoidance last time, suggesting lower inherent congestion potential.
   - 'O-R-D' could attract more users seeing it was less congested but risks creating an opposite pattern-heavy load.

6. **Decision Considerations**:
   - Choosing 'O-L-R-D' could take advantage of its untouched status, potentially balancing between shifts expected on other routes.
   - Monitoring shifts and past deserted nature makes it a latent option assuming balanced redistributions.

Based on the analysis, the decision for this round is to select route 'O-L-R-D', factoring in its previously unused state which might now hold lower congestion under current conditions.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 70

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a strategic decision for the next round, let's evaluate the last round's outcomes and analyze each option carefully:

1. **Last Round Analysis**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: 0 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-L-R-D'**: 15 drivers chose this route.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 3 drivers chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 70 points, indicating you likely chose a route with a reasonable cost that kept congestion controlled.

2. **Cost Analysis from Last Round**:
   - For 'O-L-D': Unused, so minimum possible fixed cost is theoretically 210 for segment L-D.
   - For 'O-L-R-D': The cost would be `10 * 15 (O-L segment) + 10 * 18 (R-D segment) = 150 + 180 = 330 points`, indicating high congestion.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 3 = 240 points`, showing low congestion on R-D.

3. **Route Characteristics**:
   - **'O-L-D'**: Wasn't used, suggesting low congestion if chosen by few.
   - **'O-L-R-D'**: High congestion due to 15 drivers, costly.
   - **'O-R-D'**: Few users, therefore lower cost on R-D, making it attractive.

4. **Strategic Thoughts**:
   - 'O-L-D' not being used can make it a very favorable route due to lack of load-dependent costs.
   - 'O-L-R-D' is likely to see drivers moving away due to the high cost experienced by many.
   - 'O-R-D' continues to be attractive due to maintaining low congestion historically.

5. **Predicted Shifts**:
   - With 'O-L-R-D' having been costly, drivers might switch to 'O-L-D' or continue using 'O-R-D', evening out congestion.
   - Both unused routes now look more attractive as 'O-L-R-D' likely deters due to past outcomes.

6. **Decision**:
   - 'O-L-D', being completely unused, offers low cost potential if it isn't rushed by all.
   - Consider 'O-R-D' for its continued lower congestion benefits but assume shifts.

Based on analysis, the strategic decision is to select route 'O-R-D', leveraging previous lower congestion while considering possible shifts toward 'O-L-D'.

   - Switching evenly between 'O-L-R-D' and 'O-R-D' would help maintain the lower-cost situation if not dramatically oversubscribed.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - 'O-L-R-D' could be attractive, offering flexibility and coverage via unused O-L + R-D segments.
   - 'O-R-D' similarly remains attractive for its zero utilization and limited cost if not overwhelmingly swarmed.

6. **Decision**:
   - Considering the completely free paths, 'O-L-R-D' balances by avoiding heavy segments using O-L, potentially deterring a rush seen in hard switches.

The strategic decision, balancing these points, is to choose route 'O-L-R-D', given its complete avoidance so far and potential for moderate distribution:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

   - **Your Payoff**: 90 points, indicating you likely chose a route that balanced congestion effectively.

2. **Cost Analysis from Last Round**:
   - For 'O-L-D': With no drivers, the cost is only the fixed segment, which would be minimal.
   - For 'O-L-R-D': The cost was `10 * 13 (O-L segment) + 10 * 18 (R-D segment) = 130 + 180 = 310 points`.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 5 = 260 points`.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-L-D', being completely unused, suggests a potential low-cost option if usage remains low.
   - 'O-L-R-D', although used by many, still represents a significant expense due to both segments being utilized.
   - 'O-R-D' had moderate usage and offered a lower cost compared to 'O-L-R-D'.

4. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - 'O-L-D': With consistent neglect, this might provide the lowest cost if others don't switch in large numbers.
   - 'O-R-D': While used, still offers a viable cost-effective choice if expecting minimal shifts.
   - 'O-L-R-D': With known high costs, drivers may deter from this unless expecting a drastic reduction in use.

   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: 1 driver chose this route.
   - **Your Payoff**: 20 points, indicating high costs because of choosing a congested route, likely 'O-L-D'.

2. **Cost Analysis from Last Round**:
   - For 'O-L-D': The cost was `10 * 17 + 210 = 380 points`, indicating severe congestion.
   - For 'O-L-R-D': Unused, which means it would have no congestion-based costs.
   - For 'O-R-D': The cost was `210 + 10 * 1 = 220 points`, indicating minimal congestion.

3. **Implications**:
   - 'O-L-D' being heavily crowded led to high costs, discouraging further use unless it becomes balanced.
   - 'O-L-R-D', untouched, suggests a clear opportunity for low-cost travel if others do not heavily switch to it.
   - 'O-R-D', though lightly used, shows stable costs and could draw some drivers away from 'O-L-D' due to restraint.

4. **Predict Driver Shifts**:
   - Many drivers facing high costs on 'O-L-D' are likely to consider 'O-L-R-D' or 'O-R-D' to lower their expenses.
   - 'O-L-R-D' appears highly attractive after complete avoidance.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - 'O-L-R-D' stands out due to zero usage, which could promise low congestion-related costs.
   - 'O-R-D' remains sensible with knowledge of its balance, though expect more than one driver this time.

6. **Decision**:
   - Opt for 'O-L-R-D', utilizing its previously unselected status, and seeking minimal cost impacts from predicted shifts.

Thus, the strategic decision is to go with the route 'O-L-R-D':

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 10, 'O-R-D': 8}
Your payoff was 120

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
