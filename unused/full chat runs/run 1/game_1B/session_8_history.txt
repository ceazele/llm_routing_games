System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision on which route to take, let's analyze both options and consider various scenarios:

1. **Understanding Costs:**
   - Route **O-L-D**: The cost is determined by the equation \(10X + 210\), where \(X\) is the number of drivers choosing segment O-L.
   - Route **O-R-D**: The cost is determined by the equation \(210 + 10Y\), where \(Y\) is the number of drivers choosing segment R-D.

2. **Goal:** 
   - Maximize payoff by minimizing travel cost. Since we receive an endowment of 400 points per round, our payoff is \(400 - \text{cost}\).

3. **Initial Considerations:**
   - If fewer drivers take O-L-D, my cost on that route is cheaper as the variable part (10X) is smaller.
   - Similarly, if fewer drivers take O-R-D, the cost for that route becomes attractive.

4. **Strategic Analysis:**
   - Without any historical data or hints on initial preferences, drivers might randomly choose routes. 
   - Consider the impact of an even split initially: With 9 drivers choosing O-L-D and 9 drivers choosing O-R-D:
     - For **O-L-D**, cost = \(10 \times 9 + 210 = 300\).
     - For **O-R-D**, cost = \(210 + 10 \times 9 = 300\).
     - Payoff = \(400 - 300 = 100\) for both routes.

5. **Optimal Initial Strategy:**
   - Since both routes seem equally balanced when exactly half the drivers choose each, it might be prudent to start with O-L-D assuming this situation unless I favor sequential shifts or expect others to shift.

6. **Adaptation:**
   - Observe patterns after initial rounds. If more drivers consistently choose one route, adjust by choosing the less congested route in following rounds.

Considering above points, I will choose route 'O-L-D' initially, but will remain flexible to adapt based on observed driver patterns in subsequent rounds.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 7, 'O-R-D': 11}
Your payoff was 120

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the information from the last round, let's analyze and decide which route might be best for this next round:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 7 drivers.
   - **O-R-D** had 11 drivers.
   - My payoff was 120 points.

   Since the payoff was 120, it indicates my travel cost was \(400 - 120 = 280\).

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - For route **O-L-D**, cost:
     - \(10 \times 7 + 210 = 70 + 210 = 280\)
   - For route **O-R-D**, had I chosen it, cost:
     - \(210 + 10 \times 11 = 210 + 110 = 320\)

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D was less congested last round, resulting in a lower cost.
   - Higher cost for O-R-D indicates that it was more congested with 11 drivers.

4. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - Last round's data suggests that O-L-D was the better choice by 40 points.
   - If the pattern continues and players follow last round’s choices, O-L-D might again be less congested.

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - Given the benefit from last round and assuming no major shifts, remaining with O-L-D could likely provide a similar payoff.
   - However, remain vigilant: if others also notice this, O-L-D could become more congested soon. But for now, with no new anticipated shifts, O-L-D seems optimal.

Based on this assessment, I'll choose **route O-L-D** again:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 14, 'O-R-D': 4}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the change in the number of drivers choosing each route last round, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to make a more informed decision this time:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 14 drivers.
   - **O-R-D** had 4 drivers.
   - My payoff was 50 points.

   Since the payoff was 50, it indicates my travel cost was \(400 - 50 = 350\).

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - For route **O-L-D**, cost:
     - \(10 \times 14 + 210 = 140 + 210 = 350\)
   - For route **O-R-D**, had I chosen it, cost:
     - \(210 + 10 \times 4 = 210 + 40 = 250\)

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D became significantly more congested, resulting in a much higher cost.
   - O-R-D was much less congested, offering a lower cost last round.

4. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - The pattern shows a shift towards O-L-D, possibly because more people perceived it as a better option initially.
   - With O-R-D having considerably fewer drivers, it's now the cheaper option, suggesting a strategic shift.
   - As most drivers experience the same costs, there might be swing back to O-R-D as others notice the imbalance.

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - Given the significant difference in costs last round, switching to O-R-D is likely optimal for this round.
   - Be prepared for potential shifts if many others decide to switch routes too, but currently, O-R-D offers a better opportunity for a higher payoff.

Based on this analysis, I'll choose **route O-R-D** for the upcoming round:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 4, 'O-R-D': 14}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the situation based on the data from the last round to decide on the best route for this round:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 4 drivers.
   - **O-R-D** had 14 drivers.
   - My payoff was 50 points.

   Since my payoff was 50, my travel cost was \(400 - 50 = 350\).

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - For route **O-L-D**, had I chosen it, cost:
     - \(10 \times 4 + 210 = 40 + 210 = 250\)
   - For route **O-R-D**, the cost was:
     - \(210 + 10 \times 14 = 210 + 140 = 350\)

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-R-D became more congested, leading to a higher cost for those who chose it.
   - O-L-D was much less congested last round, resulting in a lower travel cost.

4. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - Many drivers have switched from O-L-D to O-R-D, possibly due to previous congestions on O-L-D.
   - Given the last round’s results, O-L-D is now the cheaper option.
   - It's likely that others will notice this trend and may switch back to O-L-D.

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - Switching to O-L-D seems optimal given the current trends, expecting that fewer drivers on this route will result in a lower cost.
   - Anticipate possible shifts back to O-L-D but recognize that last round also involved strategic adjustments.

Based on this analysis, I'll choose **route O-L-D** for the next round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the changes observed last round, let's analyze the situation to make an informed decision:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 15 drivers.
   - **O-R-D** had 3 drivers.
   - My payoff was 40 points.

   This indicates my travel cost was \(400 - 40 = 360\).

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - For route **O-L-D**, cost:
     - \(10 \times 15 + 210 = 150 + 210 = 360\)
   - For route **O-R-D**, had I chosen it, cost:
     - \(210 + 10 \times 3 = 210 + 30 = 240\)

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D was significantly more congested, leading to a much higher travel cost.
   - O-R-D had fewer drivers, resulting in a lower cost.

4. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - The majority of drivers shifted back to O-L-D, possibly due to previous outcomes where it was cheaper, creating over-congestion.
   - O-R-D presented a much lower cost due to fewer participants.
   - The pattern suggests a pendulum swing, with drivers reacting in large numbers to previous costs.

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - Given the large shift to O-L-D, it is now prudent to switch to O-R-D to minimize travel costs.
   - Expect others may gradually notice the imbalance and switch too, but currently, O-R-D seems optimal for minimizing costs.

Based on the above analysis, I'll choose **route O-R-D** for the upcoming round:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the situation from the last round, let’s go through the decision-making process step-by-step:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 3 drivers.
   - **O-R-D** had 15 drivers.
   - My payoff was 40 points.

   This means my travel cost was \(400 - 40 = 360\).

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - For route **O-L-D**, had I chosen it, cost:
     - \(10 \times 3 + 210 = 30 + 210 = 240\)
   - For route **O-R-D**, the cost was:
     - \(210 + 10 \times 15 = 210 + 150 = 360\)

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-R-D was heavily congested last round leading to a high travel cost.
   - O-L-D was significantly less congested with only 3 drivers, resulting in a much lower cost.
   - There's been a noticeable shift of drivers swinging between routes possibly reacting to prior cost assessments.

4. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - With 15 drivers on O-R-D last round, it's likely that some of them will recognize the high cost and consider switching.
   - Given the formula, O-L-D is significantly cheaper with fewer drivers and presents an opportunity for a higher payoff.

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - Switching to O-L-D is the sensible choice given last round’s driver distribution and the low current cost.
   - Although other drivers might also react similarly, O-L-D still offers a better cost advantage given the current pattern.

Based on the above analysis, I'll choose **route O-L-D** for the upcoming round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the recent shift in the distribution of drivers between the routes, let's evaluate the situation to make a well-considered decision:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 15 drivers.
   - **O-R-D** had 3 drivers.
   - My payoff was 40 points.

   This indicates my travel cost was \(400 - 40 = 360\).

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - For route **O-L-D**, the cost was:
     - \(10 \times 15 + 210 = 150 + 210 = 360\)
   - For route **O-R-D**, had I chosen it, cost:
     - \(210 + 10 \times 3 = 210 + 30 = 240\)

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D was heavily congested leading to high travel costs.
   - O-R-D was significantly less congested with only 3 drivers, resulting in a much lower cost.
   - There seems to be a pattern of large swings, with many drivers shifting routes after experiencing high costs, leading to over-correction.

4. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - Given the large number of drivers on O-L-D, it’s likely that many will recognize the high cost and decide to switch routes.
   - O-R-D, being less congested last round, offers a lower cost and thus a higher payoff potential.

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - Moving to O-R-D is strategically sensible given its lower driver count and consequently lower cost.
   - Even if a few drivers switch back to O-R-D, it remains the route with the potential for lower costs based on the last round’s numbers.

Based on this analysis, I'll choose **route O-R-D** for the upcoming round:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the consistent oscillation between the route choices, let’s analyze the pattern and make a strategic decision for this round:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 3 drivers.
   - **O-R-D** had 15 drivers.
   - My payoff was 40 points.

   This indicates my travel cost was \(400 - 40 = 360\).

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - For route **O-L-D**, had I chosen it, cost:
     - \(10 \times 3 + 210 = 30 + 210 = 240\)
   - For route **O-R-D**, the cost was:
     - \(210 + 10 \times 15 = 210 + 150 = 360\)

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-R-D was heavily congested, resulting in a high travel cost.
   - O-L-D was significantly less congested with only 3 drivers, resulting in a much lower cost.
   - Drivers tend to react sharply to the costs incurred in previous rounds, causing swings to opposite routes.

4. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - There is a clear pattern, suggesting that drivers heavily shift to the less congested route from the previous round.
   - Given O-L-D had only 3 drivers last round and provided significantly cheaper costs, it may be at risk of becoming over-congested if many decide to switch.

5. **Anticipating Behavior:**
   - Expect some drivers to recognize the lower cost on O-L-D and potentially shift back.
   - However, considering past swings, such shifts tend to happen significantly. 

6. **Choosing a Route:**
   - While O-L-D had fewer drivers, expect others might switch too, making O-R-D potentially less congested this round than anticipated if many re-adjust towards O-L-D.
   - To avoid high costs associated with over-correction swings, choosing O-L-D is sensible, yet aware that switching aligns against extreme shifts.

Based on the analysis and anticipated driver behavior, I'll choose **route O-L-D** for this round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the recent results and the observable pattern in route selection, let's perform a detailed analysis to determine the best route for the coming round:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 16 drivers.
   - **O-R-D** had 2 drivers.
   - My payoff was 30 points.

   This indicates my travel cost was \(400 - 30 = 370\).

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - For route **O-L-D**, the cost was:
     - \(10 \times 16 + 210 = 160 + 210 = 370\)
   - For route **O-R-D**, had I chosen it, cost:
     - \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 210 + 20 = 230\)

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D is now very congested, leading to substantially higher costs.
   - O-R-D is significantly less congested, resulting in much lower costs.

4. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - The pattern indicates a strong response from drivers to shift away from high-cost routes, resulting in major oscillations.
   - Given the high number of drivers on O-L-D, it is likely that many will recognize and attempt to switch to the less congested O-R-D this round.

5. **Anticipating Behavior:**
   - Anticipate many drivers noticing the lower cost from O-R-D and considering switching to it.
   - However, the extreme imbalance from last round could mean a considerable number stay mindful to changes, preventing a repeat in congestion.

6. **Choosing a Route:**
   - Given the consistently lower driver count and cost on O-R-D, it presents a viable opportunity for a lower travel cost — it is likely the better choice.
   - However, still be aware of the pendulum effect and be prepared to adapt if needed in subsequent rounds.

Based on this assessment and to avoid congestion while aiming for a higher payoff, I'll choose **route O-R-D** for the next round:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 1, 'O-R-D': 17}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the situation with the information from the last round to optimize our route choice for the upcoming round:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 1 driver.
   - **O-R-D** had 17 drivers.
   - My payoff was 20 points.

   This indicates my travel cost was \(400 - 20 = 380\).

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - For route **O-L-D**, had I chosen it, cost would have been:
     - \(10 \times 1 + 210 = 10 + 210 = 220\)
   - For route **O-R-D**, the cost was:
     - \(210 + 10 \times 17 = 210 + 170 = 380\)

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-R-D was heavily congested, leading to very high costs.
   - O-L-D was almost empty, resulting in much lower costs.

4. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - The pattern continues to show a pendulum swing as drivers react to previous costs, heavily favoring one route over another once costs become apparent.
   - It is anticipated that drivers will notice the significantly lower cost on O-L-D and will likely switch routes in the next round.

5. **Anticipating Behavior:**
   - A substantial shift is expected from O-R-D to O-L-D as drivers react to the low costs observed on O-L-D.
   - Given such a strong trend and current placement, a shift could balance or even congest O-L-D.

6. **Choosing a Route:**
   - O-L-D offers the least congested route and thus the lowest potential cost if today's choices remain dispersion-friendly or minimal shift.
   - It's prudent to choose O-L-D for the upcoming round to capitalize on lower costs and avoid the significantly higher cost O-R-D may present if everyone reacts similarly.

Based on this analysis, I'll choose **route O-L-D** for the next round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 17, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the extreme swings in route choice from the last round, let's strategically evaluate the options for the next round:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 17 drivers.
   - **O-R-D** had 1 driver.
   - My payoff was 20 points.

   This means my travel cost was \(400 - 20 = 380\).

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - For route **O-L-D**, the cost was:
     - \(10 \times 17 + 210 = 170 + 210 = 380\)
   - For route **O-R-D**, had I chosen it, the cost would have been:
     - \(210 + 10 \times 1 = 210 + 10 = 220\)

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D became very congested with a high number of drivers, leading to high costs.
   - O-R-D had only 1 driver, making it exceptionally low in cost.

4. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - The pattern consistently shows drivers heavily shifting between routes after realizing current costs, resulting in congestion swings.
   - I anticipate many drivers will recognize the low cost on O-R-D and switch to it.

5. **Anticipating Behavior:**
   - Expect a significant shift from O-L-D to O-R-D as drivers react to the current imbalance.
   - The historical trend suggests such reactions tend to overshoot, potentially causing a similar congestion on O-R-D.

6. **Choosing a Route:**
   - Despite the likely inbound shift to O-R-D, it remains the significantly less congested and lower-cost option when switching swings are extreme.
   - This swing phenomenon suggests O-R-D as the optimal choice given the drastically reduced cost and congestion.

Based on this analysis, selecting **route O-R-D** for the next round is a reasonable strategy to minimize costs:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 1, 'O-R-D': 17}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Based on the current scenario and past patterns from the previous rounds, let's determine the best route choice:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 1 driver.
   - **O-R-D** had 17 drivers.
   - My payoff was 20 points.

   This indicates my travel cost was \(400 - 20 = 380\).

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - For route **O-L-D**, had I chosen it, the cost would have been:
     - \(10 \times 1 + 210 = 10 + 210 = 220\)
   - For route **O-R-D**, the cost was:
     - \(210 + 10 \times 17 = 210 + 170 = 380\)

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-R-D was heavily congested last round, leading to high costs.
   - O-L-D had only 1 driver, meaning much lower costs.
   
4. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - There are strong pendulum swings between the routes where most drivers switch to the less congested route observed from the previous round.
   - Considering last round's imbalance, expect many to move to O-L-D seeking lower costs.

5. **Anticipating Behavior:**
   - Many drivers will likely notice the low count on O-L-D and switch to it, but the overshoot pattern suggests it’s optimal timing to swap is anticipatory.
   - The goal is to get ahead of the pendulum or crowd movement to avoid congestion costs.

6. **Choosing a Route:**
   - Given the prior distribution and the likely large shift expected, selecting O-L-D is beneficial as it was previously less congested.
   - O-L-D is unlikely to be as congested immediately, considering the small driver count from last round, thus minimizing potential cost effectively.

I will choose **route O-L-D** for the upcoming round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the swing in route choices from last round, let's examine the situation step-by-step to decide on the optimal route for the next round:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 15 drivers.
   - **O-R-D** had 3 drivers.
   - My payoff was 40 points.

   This indicates my travel cost was \(400 - 40 = 360\).

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - For route **O-L-D**, the cost was:
     - \(10 \times 15 + 210 = 150 + 210 = 360\)
   - For route **O-R-D**, had I chosen it, the cost would have been:
     - \(210 + 10 \times 3 = 210 + 30 = 240\)

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D became quite congested, resulting in high travel costs.
   - O-R-D was much less congested, offering the benefit of a lower travel cost.

4. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - The significant difference in driver numbers indicates a reactive behavior where drivers shift heavily in response to observed costs.
   - It's likely that many drivers on O-L-D will recognize the high costs and move to O-R-D in the next round.

5. **Anticipating Behavior:**
   - Expect a significant number of drivers to switch from O-L-D to O-R-D since O-R-D had lower costs.
   - Be mindful of a potentially large swing in route choice, which could lead to congestion in the less populated route.

6. **Choosing a Route:**
   - Switching to O-R-D offers a cost advantage since it was less congested last round.
   - Despite potential shifts, O-R-D remains the choice that could yield a higher payoff due to its previously lower driver count and costs.

Based on this analysis, I'll choose **route O-R-D** for the next round:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 2, 'O-R-D': 16}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the strong shift in route selection, let's analyze the situation to make the best possible decision for the next round:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 2 drivers.
   - **O-R-D** had 16 drivers.
   - My payoff was 30 points.

   This means my travel cost was \(400 - 30 = 370\).

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - For route **O-L-D**, had I chosen it, the cost would have been:
     - \(10 \times 2 + 210 = 20 + 210 = 230\)
   - For route **O-R-D**, the cost was:
     - \(210 + 10 \times 16 = 210 + 160 = 370\)

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-R-D became heavily congested, leading to a very high travel cost.
   - O-L-D had only 2 drivers, resulting in a much lower cost.

4. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - There is a pattern of significant oscillation as drivers react to the previous round’s congestion, heavily shifting routes.
   - Expect drivers on the congested O-R-D to switch to the less congested O-L-D next round.

5. **Anticipating Behavior:**
   - It’s highly likely many drivers will recognize the low cost on O-L-D and attempt to switch there, moving away from the congested O-R-D.
   - The swing tendency may not lead to immediate full congestion but definitely a noticeable shift.

6. **Choosing a Route:**
   - O-L-D presents the optimal cost opportunity for the next round given its low congestion last time.
   - Selecting O-L-D leverages this pattern and avoids the congestion seen on O-R-D, positioning for a lower travel cost this round.

Based on this analysis, I'll choose **route O-L-D** for the next round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the recurring pattern of swings between route choices, we need to carefully consider the strategy for this round to optimize payoff:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 15 drivers.
   - **O-R-D** had 3 drivers.
   - My payoff was 40 points.

   This indicates my travel cost was \(400 - 40 = 360\).

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - For route **O-L-D**, the cost was:
     - \(10 \times 15 + 210 = 150 + 210 = 360\)
   - For route **O-R-D**, had I chosen it, cost would have been:
     - \(210 + 10 \times 3 = 210 + 30 = 240\)

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D was heavily congested, resulting in a high travel cost.
   - O-R-D was less congested, offering a lower cost.

4. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - The pattern suggests players react strongly to congestion by shifting routes. After experiencing high costs, many will likely consider switching to the alternative route (O-R-D).
   - Given fewer drivers on O-R-D, it's likely to be the more attractive option in the next round.

5. **Anticipating Behavior:**
   - Many drivers on O-L-D will probably notice the high costs and move to O-R-D.
   - There is a high likelihood of shifts creating an imbalance but predicting less congestion this round on O-R-D.

6. **Choosing a Route:**
   - With O-R-D’s lower driver count, it's the rational choice for potentially minimizing costs and maximizing payoffs if a balanced shift occurs.
   - Opting for O-R-D aligns with avoiding congestion and gaining from lower variable cost due to the smaller driver load.

Based on these considerations, I'll choose **route O-R-D** for the upcoming round:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 2, 'O-R-D': 16}

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 2 drivers.
   - **O-R-D** had 16 drivers.
   - My payoff was 30 points.

   This indicates my travel cost was \(400 - 30 = 370\).

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - For route **O-L-D**, had I chosen it, the cost would have been:
     - \(10 \times 2 + 210 = 20 + 210 = 230\)
   - For route **O-R-D**, the cost was:
     - \(210 + 10 \times 16 = 210 + 160 = 370\)

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-R-D was heavily congested, leading to higher costs.
   - O-L-D was significantly less congested, resulting in a much lower cost.

4. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - Players typically react to high costs by shifting routes, often resulting in significant oscillations.
   - Given the low cost on O-L-D last round, it's likely more players would consider switching to O-L-D to benefit from reduced congestion.

5. **Anticipating Behavior:**
   - Many drivers on the congested O-R-D are likely to move to O-L-D, realizing the lower costs there.
   - The decision should aim at choosing the less congested route based on prior swings and costs.

6. **Choosing a Route:**
   - O-L-D, now having been significantly less congested, presents a better opportunity to minimize costs.
   - Switching to O-L-D should strategically capture the lower travel cost while avoiding the foreseeable congestion on O-R-D.

Based on this strategy and pattern recognition, I'll choose **route O-L-D** for the next round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

     - \(10 \times 16 + 210 = 160 + 210 = 370\)
   - For route **O-R-D**, had I chosen it, cost would have been:
     - \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 210 + 20 = 230\)

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D was heavily congested, resulting in a high travel cost.
   - O-R-D had significantly fewer drivers, offering a much lower cost.

4. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - Historically, players switch from one highly congested route to the less congested one based on the prior round’s costs.
   - Given the previous high driver count on O-L-D, many are likely to switch to O-R-D seeking lower costs.

5. **Anticipating Behavior:**
   - A significant shift from O-L-D to O-R-D is expected, as drivers chase after the route with fewer drivers from last round.
   - The drastic shift from one extreme to another usually leads to these pendulum-like swings.

6. **Choosing a Route:**
   - Opting for O-R-D is strategic due to its much lower congestion last round. It promises lower costs compared to staying with a potentially congested O-L-D.
   - Choosing O-R-D should align with avoiding high costs by positioning on a less predictable, alternating current.

Based on this analysis, I'll choose **route O-R-D** for the next round:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 2, 'O-R-D': 16}

     - \(10 \times 2 + 210 = 20 + 210 = 230\)
   - For route **O-R-D**, the cost was:
     - \(210 + 10 \times 16 = 210 + 160 = 370\)

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-R-D was heavily congested, leading to a high cost.
   - O-L-D was much less congested, offering a lower cost.

4. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - There is a clear pattern of players switching to the less congested route.
   - Given the high driver count and cost on O-R-D last round, it is likely that many players will notice the lower cost on O-L-D and decide to switch.

5. **Anticipating Behavior:**
   - A switch is expected from O-R-D to O-L-D by drivers seeking to minimize costs.
   - Recognizing the oscillation pattern, being on the less congested route provides a payoff advantage.

6. **Choosing a Route:**
   - Choosing O-L-D capitalizes on the anticipated driver shift toward reducing costs while O-R-D experiences potential oversaturation.
   - It's crucial to balance the response to observed distribution by moving where minimal congestion is likely.

Based on these observations and anticipating player behavior, I'll choose **route O-L-D** for the next round:

   - O-R-D was much less congested, offering a lower travel cost.

4. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - There is a clear pattern where drivers respond to high costs by switching to the less congested route.
   - Given the significant number of drivers on O-L-D last round, it's highly probable that many will switch to O-R-D seeking lower costs.

5. **Anticipating Behavior:**
   - Expect a considerable shift from O-L-D to O-R-D as drivers aim to balance out the congestion and cost disparities.
   - Anticipating this shift helps avoid congestion by aligning with trends toward lower cost paths.

6. **Choosing a Route:**
   - Opting for O-R-D this round makes strategic sense given its low congestion and cost from the previous round.
   - Selecting O-R-D leverages the identified swing pattern, with historically low congestion favoring reduced travel costs.

   - O-L-D was significantly less congested, resulting in much lower costs.

4. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - Observing the drastic cost difference, drivers will likely want to switch to O-L-D to take advantage of the lower congestion.
   - This is part of a recurring pattern where heavy congestion on one route leads to a shift towards the less congested alternative in the next round.

5. **Anticipating Behavior:**
   - Expect a substantial number of drivers to switch from O-R-D to O-L-D due to the cost advantage observed last round.
   - This shift should be capitalized on by opting for the previously less congested route.

6. **Choosing a Route:**
   - O-L-D offers a more promising potential for lower costs due to its fewer previous round congestion.
   - By choosing O-L-D, I aim to avoid the high costs associated with O-R-D's congestion and leverage the expected shift in driver behavior.

{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 2, 'O-R-D': 16}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision based on the current situation and past patterns, let's consider each step carefully:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 2 drivers.
   - **O-R-D** had 16 drivers.
   - My payoff was 30 points, meaning my travel cost was \(400 - 30 = 370\).

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - For route **O-L-D**, the cost would have been:
     - \(10 \times 2 + 210 = 20 + 210 = 230\).
   - For route **O-R-D**, the cost was:
     - \(210 + 10 \times 16 = 210 + 160 = 370\).

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-R-D was heavily congested, leading to high costs.
   - O-L-D experienced significantly less congestion, resulting in lower costs.

4. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - Historically, drivers tend to react to high costs by switching to the less congested route.
   - Given the large cost difference, many drivers from O-R-D will likely move to O-L-D, seeking lower costs.

5. **Anticipating Behavior:**
   - Expect a significant shift from O-R-D to O-L-D as drivers look to reduce their travel costs.
   - Understanding this pattern helps in aligning with the route expected to have lower congestion.

6. **Choosing a Route:**
   - O-L-D is strategically advantageous as it had lower congestion last round, suggesting potential for continued lower costs.
   - This choice focuses on maximizing payoff by aligning with expected driver behavior and anticipated reduced costs.

Based on this analysis, I'll choose **route O-L-D** for the next round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a strategic decision among the available routes ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D'], let's evaluate each option based on potential costs and anticipated driver behavior:

1. **Understanding Costs for Each Route:**
   - **Route O-L-D:**
     - Cost = \(10X + 210\)
     - \(X\) is the number of drivers on segment O-L.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:**
     - Cost = \(10X + 10Y\)
     - \(X\) is the number of drivers on segment O-L.
     - \(Y\) is the number of drivers on segment R-D.
   - **Route O-R-D:**
     - Cost = \(210 + 10Y\)
     - \(Y\) is the number of drivers on segment R-D.

2. **Analyzing Route Dynamics:**
   - **O-L-D** involves a fixed cost on L-D, making its variability linked to how many choose segment O-L.
   - **O-L-R-D** provides flexibility by traveling via L-R at no cost but depends on congestion at both O-L and R-D, hence its total is variable at both nodes.
   - **O-R-D** offers a fixed cost on segment O-R but increases with congestion on segment R-D.

3. **Anticipating Player Choices:**
   - Players tend to react to cost differences by switching to the perceived least congested and lowest cost route.
   - Expect potentially balanced shifts across lesser-utilized routes to minimize travel costs.

4. **Choosing a Route:**
   - **O-L-R-D** might offer a strategic advantage due to its flexibility in handling congestion as it doesn’t incur the fixed middle segment cost.
   - Attempting **O-L-R-D** could minimize costs, assuming moderate driver distribution on O-L and R-D.

5. **Decision:**
   - Select **O-L-R-D** if expecting moderate congestion across nodes, leveraging the zero-cost segment L-R for strategic cost savings. 

Given this analysis, I'll choose **route O-L-R-D**:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make the best decision for this round, let's analyze the options considering what happened last round:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 0 drivers.
   - **O-L-R-D** had 16 drivers, which was heavily congested.
   - **O-R-D** had 2 drivers, resulting in lower congestion.
   - My payoff was 60 points, indicating that the chosen route (O-L-R-D) had a higher cost because of the congestion.

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - **Route O-L-D:**
     - Cost = \(10X + 210\)
     - Last round, would have been \(10 \times 0 + 210 = 210\).
   - **Route O-L-R-D**:
     - Cost = \(10X + 10Y\)
     - Last round, was \(10 \times 16 + 10 \times 16 = 320\).
   - **Route O-R-D:**
     - Cost = \(210 + 10Y\)
     - Last round, would have been \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 230\).

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D was not chosen by anyone, leading to a guaranteed minimum cost if the pattern remains.
   - O-L-R-D had high congestion and costs.
   - O-R-D had lower congestion, but O-L-D offered potentially even less cost if chosen.

4. **Anticipating Player Choices:**
   - Drivers are likely to notice the high congestion on O-L-R-D and may switch to O-L-D or O-R-D.
   - O-L-D might attract more drivers expecting low costs, but starting at zero drivers gives it a cost advantage unless drivers shift heavily.

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - **O-L-D** appears advantageous if expecting it to remain less congested or slightly used.
   - Selecting **O-L-D** could provide minimal costs due to its last round's zero congestion starting point. 

Based on this analysis, I'll choose **route O-L-D** for the upcoming round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 13, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 5}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To determine the best route for this round, let's analyze the situation and outcomes from the previous round once more:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 13 drivers, resulting in significant congestion.
   - **O-L-R-D** had 0 drivers, which means there was an opportunity for this route to be less costly.
   - **O-R-D** had 5 drivers and moderate congestion.

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - **Route O-L-D:**
     - Cost last round = \(10 \times 13 + 210 = 130 + 210 = 340\).
   - **Route O-L-R-D**:
     - Would have had a cost = \(10 \times 0 + 10 \times 0 = 0\).
   - **Route O-R-D:**
     - Cost last round = \(210 + 10 \times 5 = 210 + 50 = 260\).

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D experienced high congestion, boosting costs significantly.
   - O-L-R-D was entirely unused, offering a strategic low-cost opportunity if chosen wisely this round.
   - O-R-D had moderate usage, resulting in moderate costs.

4. **Anticipating Player Choices:**
   - Players are likely to switch from O-L-D due to the high costs from last round.
   - O-L-R-D may attract drivers due to its zero cost if drivers move seeking an unutilized route.
   - O-R-D may stabilize as players decide between trying O-L-R-D and O-R-D.

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - **O-L-R-D** is a favorable choice due to its complete lack of usage last round, suggesting a potential low-cost path.
   - Switching to **O-L-R-D** can leverage the likely lower congestion if many perceive it as a minimally used route and thus cost-efficient.

Given these considerations, I'll choose **route O-L-R-D** for this round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 70

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To determine the best route for this upcoming round, let's analyze the information from the last round:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 0 drivers, indicating a potential low-cost opportunity.
   - **O-L-R-D** had 15 drivers, leading to significant congestion.
   - **O-R-D** had 3 drivers, indicating moderate congestion.

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - **Route O-L-D:**
     - Cost last round would have been \(10 \times 0 + 210 = 210\), due to 0 drivers on O-L.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:**
     - Cost = \(10 \times 15 + 10 \times 15 = 150 + 150 = 300\).
   - **Route O-R-D:**
     - Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 3 = 210 + 30 = 240\).

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D was completely unused, presenting a potential circular path with minimal cost if similarly undervalued this round.
   - O-L-R-D was highly congested, inflating costs, leading to a likely switch by players to other routes.
   - O-R-D had comparatively minimal congestion, making it moderately attractive.

4. **Anticipating Player Choices:**
   - Players will likely move away from O-L-R-D due to high costs, considering either O-L-D or O-R-D based on perceived low cost.
   - O-L-D would draw attention because it offers consistently low costs if the pattern of underuse continues or switches moderately.

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - **O-L-D** seems the most viable choice given its complete lack of usage last round, promising minimal congestion and optimal costs.
   - Choosing **O-L-D** leverages the cost efficiency from last round and expectations for reduced congestion if others over-switch towards O-R-D or move equally.

Based on this information and anticipated player behavior, I'll choose **route O-L-D** for this round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To strategically decide on the best route for the current round, let’s carefully evaluate the outcomes from the last round and anticipated player behavior:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 16 drivers, indicating high congestion and costs.
   - **O-L-R-D** had 0 drivers, suggesting a potential low-cost opportunity due to lack of usage.
   - **O-R-D** had 2 drivers, indicating minimal congestion.

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - **Route O-L-D:**
     - Cost = \(10 \times 16 + 210 = 160 + 210 = 370\).
   - **Route O-L-R-D:**
     - Would have had a cost = \(10 \times 0 + 10 \times 0 = 0\) since no drivers used it.
   - **Route O-R-D:**
     - Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 210 + 20 = 230\).

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D was highly congested, leading to very high costs last round.
   - O-L-R-D was entirely unused, indicating a significant opportunity for very low costs if it remains underutilized.
   - O-R-D had minimal congestion, presenting lower costs than O-L-D but higher than O-L-R-D if used tactically.

4. **Anticipating Player Choices:**
   - Players on O-L-D are likely to seek alternatives due to the high costs incurred, likely shifting toward O-L-R-D or potentially O-R-D.
   - O-L-R-D, having been unused last round, may attract attention due to its lack of congestion and low cost potential.

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - Both O-L-R-D and O-R-D offer strategic opportunities, with O-L-R-D providing a potential low-cost path due to no usage last round.
   - Choosing **O-L-R-D** leverages the lack of congestion for possibly achieving optimal cost efficiency if others do not overly shift to it.

Based on this analysis, I'll choose **route O-L-R-D** for the next round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 12, 'O-R-D': 6}
Your payoff was 100

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the outcomes from the previous round, let's evaluate the best route choice by considering past patterns and expected behaviors:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 0 drivers, presenting an opportunity for low-cost travel.
   - **O-L-R-D** had 12 drivers, suggesting moderate congestion.
   - **O-R-D** had 6 drivers, indicating higher congestion compared to O-L-D yet less than that on O-L-R-D.

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - **Route O-L-D:**
     - Cost last round would have been \(10 \times 0 + 210 = 210\).
   - **Route O-L-R-D:**
     - Cost = \(10 \times 12 + 10 \times 12 = 120 + 120 = 240\).
   - **Route O-R-D:**
     - Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 6 = 210 + 60 = 270\).

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D was not utilized, offering the least cost and presenting a potentially attractive option based on its minimal expected congestion.
   - O-L-R-D encountered moderate use, suggesting potential for lower costs than O-R-D but more than O-L-D.
   - O-R-D had more drivers, resulting in comparatively higher costs than O-L-D.

4. **Anticipating Player Choices:**
   - With O-L-D not used at all, it may attract drivers looking for a low-cost option due to its lack of congestion.
   - O-L-R-D might see a reduction in drivers in favor of O-L-D or O-R-D, as it was moderately congested.

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - **O-L-D** appears attractive due to its unused potential and consequent low predicted cost with no player congestion last round.
   - Opting for **O-L-D** leverages the cost efficiency observable from last rounds if others continue to diversify or overcorrect to other routes.

Based on this reasoning, I'll choose **route O-L-D** for the next round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 18, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 0}
Your payoff was 10

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the previous results to make an informed decision for this round:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 18 drivers, leading to maximum congestion and costs.
   - **O-L-R-D** and **O-R-D** had 0 drivers, suggesting opportunity for minimal cost utilization.

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - **Route O-L-D:**
     - Cost = \(10 \times 18 + 210 = 180 + 210 = 390\).
   - **Route O-L-R-D:**
     - Would have had a cost = \(10 \times 0 + 10 \times 0 = 0\), due to zero usage.
   - **Route O-R-D:**
     - Would have had a cost = \(210 + 10 \times 0 = 210\), due to zero usage.

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D was fully utilized and therefore highly costly.
   - Both O-L-R-D and O-R-D were completely unused, offering potential for significantly lower costs.

4. **Anticipating Player Choices:**
   - Given the extreme congestion on O-L-D, players will likely shift away, seeking the advantage of unused routes.
   - With both O-L-R-D and O-R-D unused, players must decide based on potential driver behavior.

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - **O-L-R-D** is strategically advantageous, offering potential zero-cost opportunities if others spread between options or focus on O-R-D.
   - Choosing **O-L-R-D** can benefit from the anticipated shift and possible minimal cost, leveraging its lack of prior use.

Based on the above analysis, I'll choose **route O-L-R-D** for the upcoming round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 7, 'O-R-D': 11}

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - **Route O-L-D:**
     - Would have had a cost = \(10 \times 0 + 210 = 210\).
   - **Route O-L-R-D:**
     - Cost = \(10 \times 7 + 10 \times 11 = 70 + 110 = 180\).
   - **Route O-R-D:**
     - Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 11 = 210 + 110 = 320\).

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D was completely unused, offering a potential low-cost advantage.
   - O-L-R-D was lightly used, indicating lower costs than O-R-D due to a balanced number of participants.
   - O-R-D had the highest number of drivers, resulting in the highest cost.

4. **Anticipating Player Choices:**
   - Players who experienced high costs on O-R-D are likely to consider O-L-D or O-L-R-D for lower costs.
   - O-L-D is attractive for players seeking minimal congestion and cost given its zero usage last round.

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - **O-L-D** appears highly advantageous, offering potentially minimal congestion and costs if competitors redistribute between O-R-D and O-L-R-D.
   - Opting for **O-L-D** leverages its zero previous use, allowing for cost-effective travel if expectations for redistribution hold.

Based on this analysis, I'll choose **route O-L-D** for the next round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}

   - O-L-R-D had low use, offering significantly lower costs.
   - O-R-D was entirely unused, presenting a potential least-cost path if expectations of spread hold.

4. **Anticipating Player Choices:**
   - Players on the high-cost O-L-D will likely switch to O-L-R-D or potentially move to the lower-cost opportunity on O-R-D.
   - O-R-D draws attention for having no drivers, and minimal prior use suggests low costs.

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - **O-R-D** is the strategically viable choice as it had not been utilized, suggesting potential for minimized costs and congestion.
   - Opting for **O-R-D** addresses both the low congestion and allows for possibly more efficient cost control as players adjust.

Based on this analysis, I'll choose **route O-R-D** for the next round:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D was not used, presenting a significant opportunity for minimized cost.
   - O-L-R-D had minimal use, offering potentially lower costs due to lack of congestion.
   - O-R-D was heavily congested, resulting in very high costs.

4. **Anticipating Player Choices:**
   - Players burdened by high costs in O-R-D may move to O-L-D or O-L-R-D seeking cost relief.
   - O-L-D, being completely unused, may draw those seeking the most significant minimized cost.

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - **O-L-D** appears optimal due to being unused and therefore least congested, providing a higher opportunity for cost-effective travel.
   - Choosing **O-L-D** takes advantage of its zero-previous use and low congestion, expected to offer lower costs in the coming round as players adjust.

Based on this analysis, I'll choose **route O-L-D** for the next round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 18, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 0}
Your payoff was 10

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the situation with the aim of making an optimal choice for the upcoming round:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 18 drivers, resulting in maximum congestion and very high costs.
   - **O-L-R-D** had 0 drivers, indicating a complete under-utilization and potential for low-cost.
   - **O-R-D** had 0 drivers, also presenting an unused opportunity for minimal cost.

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - **Route O-L-D:**
     - Cost = \(10 \times 18 + 210 = 180 + 210 = 390\).
   - **Route O-L-R-D:**
     - Would have had a cost = \(10 \times 0 + 10 \times 0 = 0\) due to absence of drivers.
   - **Route O-R-D:**
     - Would have had a cost = \(210 + 10 \times 0 = 210\) due to absence of drivers.

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D's complete congestion led to the highest travel costs.
   - Both O-L-R-D and O-R-D were not used at all, offering significant potential for minimizing travel costs if chosen appropriately.

4. **Anticipating Player Choices:**
   - Players who experienced the high costs on O-L-D will seek to move to routes with no prior usage (O-L-R-D or O-R-D) to minimize their costs.
   - Both O-L-R-D and O-R-D could attract drivers seeking drastically reduced costs due to lack of prior congestion.

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - **O-L-R-D** seems particularly advantageous if it remains strategically less chosen, leveraging the complete absence of drivers from last round for potentially zero cost.
   - Opting for **O-L-R-D** could minimize cost by taking advantage of its zero usage and avoiding possible over-switching to O-R-D.

Based on this reasoning, I'll choose **route O-L-R-D** for the next round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

   - **Route O-L-R-D:**
     - Cost = \(10 \times 13 + 10 \times 5 = 130 + 50 = 180\).
   - **Route O-R-D:**
     - Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 5 = 210 + 50 = 260\).

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D was not utilized, offering the lowest-cost path last round if selected wisely.
   - O-L-R-D had significant use, indicating higher costs due to congestion.
   - O-R-D had fewer drivers than O-L-R-D but higher than O-L-D, leading to moderate costs.

4. **Anticipating Player Choices:**
   - Players who encountered higher costs on O-L-R-D will potentially distribute between O-L-D and O-R-D seeking reduced costs.
   - As O-L-D remains unused, it could attract players looking for the least congested route.

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - **O-L-D** is strategically appealing due to its lack of use, suggesting the potential for minimal costs if others spread or switch to O-R-D.
   - Opting for **O-L-D** leverages last round's zero usage to achieve cost minimization.

Based on this analysis, I'll choose **route O-L-D** for the next round:

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D was not utilized at all, providing the lowest potential cost due to zero congestion.
   - Both O-L-R-D and O-R-D were used with O-L-R-D being slightly more congested than O-R-D, yet offering a balance of cost and usage.
   - Players likely avoided O-L-D, indicating potential interest in exploiting its low-cost opportunity this round.

4. **Anticipating Player Choices:**
   - Players who encountered higher costs on O-R-D may gravitate towards O-L-D for potential cost savings.
   - O-L-D is likely to attract attention but some players might remain or move to O-L-R-D seeking a balance.

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - **O-L-D** is advantageous due to its previously zero usage, suggesting lower costs if others redistribute or focus on O-L-R-D.
   - Selecting **O-L-D** maximizes the potential for minimal costs by exploiting its lack of use.

Considering this analysis, I'll choose **route O-L-D** for the next round:

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - **O-L-D** appears to be the best option given its zero usage, suggesting minimized costs if others redistribute as expected.
   - Selecting **O-L-D** aims for cost reduction based on potential drivers moving away from more used routes.

Taking these insights into account, I'll choose **route O-L-D** for the next round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 17, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision for this round, let's review the previous round's results and analyze potential shifts in player behavior:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 17 drivers, indicating high congestion and very high costs.
   - **O-L-R-D** had 0 drivers, indicating a completely unused opportunity for minimal cost.
   - **O-R-D** had 1 driver, indicating negligible congestion.

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - **Route O-L-D:**
     - Cost = \(10 \times 17 + 210 = 170 + 210 = 380\).
   - **Route O-L-R-D:**
     - Would have had a cost = \(10 \times 0 + 10 \times 0 = 0\) since it was unused.
   - **Route O-R-D:**
     - Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 1 = 210 + 10 = 220\).

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D was heavily congested, leading to high travel costs.
   - O-L-R-D was entirely unused, presenting an opportunity for the lowest cost.
   - O-R-D was very lightly used, resulting in lower costs.

4. **Anticipating Player Choices:**
   - Players who encountered high costs on O-L-D will likely seek alternatives. They may consider O-L-R-D and O-R-D based on perceived lower costs.
   - O-L-R-D, having not been used, presents a very attractive option for those seeking to avoid the congestion and minimize costs.

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - **O-L-R-D** is optimal, as it remains an untouched option with potential for minimal cost. Choosing this route can benefit from very low congestion if other drivers redistribute as expected.
   - By selecting **O-L-R-D**, you can leverage its last round's non-use to maximize cost efficiency.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 17, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To determine the most effective route for this round, let’s thoroughly review and predict from the previous outcomes:

1. **Review Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D** had 17 drivers, resulting in high congestion and costs.
   - **O-L-R-D** had 0 drivers, indicating it was completely unused and presenting an opportunity for minimal costs.
   - **O-R-D** had 1 driver, showing very light congestion and relatively low cost.

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - **Route O-L-D:**
     - Cost = \(10 \times 17 + 210 = 170 + 210 = 380\).
   - **Route O-L-R-D:**
     - Would have been \(10 \times 0 + 10 \times 0 = 0\) as it was not used.
   - **Route O-R-D:**
     - Cost = \(210 + 10 \times 1 = 210 + 10 = 220\).

3. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - O-L-D experienced extreme congestion leading to high costs.
   - O-L-R-D had no drivers, indicating an ideal path for minimal costs.
   - O-R-D had minimal usage, offering a lower-cost route.

4. **Anticipating Player Choices:**
   - Drivers facing high costs on O-L-D will likely shift toward O-L-R-D or O-R-D seeking lower costs.
   - O-L-R-D's zero usage makes it highly attractive for those seeking to minimize congestion and cost.

5. **Choosing a Route:**
   - **O-L-R-D** is the logical choice with its prior non-use suggesting minimal costs if players adjust as expected.
   - Opting for **O-L-R-D** capitalizes on its unused status and aims for cost efficiency.

Based on this analysis, I'll choose **route O-L-R-D** for the next round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```
