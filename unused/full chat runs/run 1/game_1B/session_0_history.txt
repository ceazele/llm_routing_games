System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision about which route to choose, we need to consider the costs associated with both routes and aim to minimize our travel cost to maximize our payoff. Here are the step-by-step considerations:

1. **Understanding the Cost Functions**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: Cost = 10 * X + 210
     - X is the number of drivers choosing O-L-D.
   - **Route O-R-D**: Cost = 210 + 10 * Y
     - Y is the number of drivers choosing O-R-D.

2. **Endowment and Payoff**:
   - Each round starts with an endowment of 400 points.
   - The goal is to maximize payoff, which is calculated as:
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost

3. **Route Decision Factors**:
   - If more drivers choose O-L-D, the cost on segment O-L increases, making O-R-D potentially more attractive.
   - Conversely, if more drivers choose O-R-D, the cost on segment R-D increases, making O-L-D potentially more attractive.

4. **Initial Hypothesis**:
   - Since the network and decision are symmetrical in terms of cost function setup, initially, we might assume both routes to have an equal chance of being chosen by others.

5. **Strategic Consideration**:
   - In initial rounds, without prior information on other drivers' behavior, a balanced initial choice or switching strategy might be reasonable to gather information.
   - Over rounds, observe if there is a trend or pattern in the number of drivers choosing each route to adjust decisions accordingly.
   - A strategy could be to choose the route that seemed less preferred in the last few rounds to minimize congestion and reduce travel cost.

6. **Equal Starting Point**:
   - For the first choice, given the symmetry and lack of initial data, choose any route as a starting point. In this strategy, we will pick one and then adjust based on future rounds' outcomes.

7. **Decision**:
   - For this round, choose 'O-R-D' as the initial choice. This choice is arbitrary for the first round and will be assessed against outcomes for future adjustments.

Given this analysis, here's the decision:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 7, 'O-R-D': 11}
Your payoff was 80

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the situation from the last round and consider the steps for making the next decision:

1. **Review of Last Round**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 7 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-L-D = 10 * 7 + 210 = 280.
   - **Route O-R-D**: 11 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-R-D = 210 + 10 * 11 = 320.
   - Your payoff was 80.
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost
     - So, Travel Cost = 400 - 80 = 320, confirming you chose route O-R-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-R-D was more crowded, leading to a higher travel cost of 320.
   - Route O-L-D had fewer drivers, with a lower cost of 280.
   - Choosing a less popular route tends to minimize travel costs, increasing payoffs.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - Given more drivers went on O-R-D last round, there's potential for O-L-D to be less expensive if the distribution remains similar.
   - Anticipate if other players might recognize the same pattern and switch routes, potentially balancing player distribution or shifting congestion.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - By shifting to the less crowded route based on prior round results, the objective is to reduce the cost and improve the payoff.
   - Given the last round's results, it seems advantageous to select route O-L-D for this round.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Choose route O-L-D to minimize anticipated congestion and lower potential travel costs.

Based on this analysis, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 14, 'O-R-D': 4}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's evaluate the situation from the last round and use it to inform our decision:

1. **Review of Last Round**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 14 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-L-D = 10 * 14 + 210 = 350.
   - **Route O-R-D**: 4 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-R-D = 210 + 10 * 4 = 250.
   - Your payoff was 50.
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost
     - So, Travel Cost = 400 - 50 = 350, confirming you chose route O-L-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-L-D became much more crowded, leading to a higher travel cost of 350.
   - Route O-R-D was less crowded, resulting in a lower cost of 250.
   - More participants moved to route O-L-D, which increased the costs significantly.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - The significant shift to O-L-D suggests that many participants reacted similarly, possibly due to prior cost insights.
   - Being proactive about recognizing potential shifts can help select a less congested route.
   - It's likely that other drivers might now realize O-R-D was less crowded last round and switch, but some might remain due to inertia or misreaction.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - Given Route O-L-D's high number last round, Route O-R-D is likely to have fewer players this round if players gradually balance out again.
   - The goal is to switch to a less congested route and capitalize on lower travel cost.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the last round's heavy congestion in O-L-D, choosing route O-R-D should present a lower travel cost opportunity.

Taking into account these insights, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 4, 'O-R-D': 14}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze last round's results and formulate a strategy for this round:

1. **Review of Last Round**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 4 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-L-D = 10 * 4 + 210 = 250.
   - **Route O-R-D**: 14 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-R-D = 210 + 10 * 14 = 350.
   - Your payoff was 50.
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost
     - Therefore, Travel Cost = 400 - 50 = 350, confirming you chose route O-R-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-R-D became much more crowded, leading to a high travel cost of 350.
   - Route O-L-D had fewer drivers, preserving a lower cost of 250.
   - More participants switched back to route O-R-D, which made O-L-D the more economical option last round.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - With a significant congestion on O-R-D, participants experienced high costs, likely prompting them to switch in the next round.
   - It's expected that some drivers will shift to O-L-D based on last round's congestion. However, the magnitude of shift is uncertain.
   - Choosing the less crowded route from the last round (O-L-D) is a strategic move to potentially experience lower costs.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - Based on last round’s congestion on O-R-D, switching to O-L-D seems a prudent choice under normal circumstances if assuming others will also respond to cost differentials similarly.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Aim to choose route O-L-D to minimize anticipated congestion and travel costs, given the significant crowd on O-R-D in the previous round.

Based on this reasoning, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's evaluate the previous round's outcome and use it to inform the decision for this round:

1. **Review of Last Round**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 15 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-L-D = 10 * 15 + 210 = 360.
   - **Route O-R-D**: 3 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-R-D = 210 + 10 * 3 = 240.
   - Your payoff was 40.
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost
     - Therefore, Travel Cost = 400 - 40 = 360, confirming you chose route O-L-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-L-D was heavily congested, leading to increased travel costs of 360.
   - Route O-R-D had very few drivers, resulting in a much lower cost of 240.
   - More participants seemed to anticipate Route O-R-D would become congested again, vastly shifting the balance to O-L-D, making it more costly.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - With such high congestion on O-L-D, many drivers will likely reconsider their choice and may switch back to O-R-D.
   - The flip-flop nature seen in route selection so far suggests playing against the grain could result in a better outcome.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - Given the high number of drivers on O-L-D and the significantly lower cost of O-R-D, it would be strategic to choose the less crowded O-R-D.
   - Anticipate the likelihood of drivers reacting to last round's congestion and adjust accordingly to capitalize on lower predicted costs.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Opting for route O-R-D is expected to minimize travel cost due to the assumed shift of drivers from O-L-D to O-R-D after last round's high congestion on O-L-D.

In light of these considerations, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Based on the outcomes and patterns from the previous rounds, let's consider our decision for this round.

1. **Review of Last Round**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 3 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-L-D = 10 * 3 + 210 = 240.
   - **Route O-R-D**: 15 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-R-D = 210 + 10 * 15 = 360.
   - Your payoff was 40.
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost
     - Therefore, Travel Cost = 400 - 40 = 360, confirming you chose route O-R-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-R-D was heavily congested with 15 drivers, resulting in a high cost of 360.
   - Route O-L-D had significantly fewer drivers, leading to a lower cost of 240.
   - This indicates players significantly shifted to O-R-D, causing substantial congestion and higher costs.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - Given the heavy congestion on O-R-D, it’s reasonable to expect that many drivers will react by switching to O-L-D in the current round.
   - Observing the oscillating pattern where drivers switch en masse between rounds to the less used route suggests a new shift is likely.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - Anticipate a shift from O-R-D to O-L-D by other participants as they seek to avoid the projected high costs on O-R-D.
   - Opting for the historically less crowded route might offer a strategic advantage, minimizing travel costs.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Selecting route O-L-D is expected to present a lower cost opportunity due to last round’s congestion on O-R-D, where many drivers will likely reconsider and shift accordingly.

Thus, applying these considerations, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

   - Your payoff was 40.
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost
     - Therefore, Travel Cost = 400 - 40 = 360, confirming you chose route O-L-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-L-D was heavily congested, leading to a high travel cost of 360.
   - Route O-R-D had very few drivers, resulting in a much lower cost of 240.
   - This indicates a significant shift in drivers moving to O-L-D, likely anticipating an O-R-D congestion that did not materialize.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - Given the high congestion on O-L-D, it's reasonable to anticipate that many drivers will react by switching to O-R-D in the current round.
   - The variance in route choice suggests participants are actively responding to previous rounds' feedback, indicating a tendency to overcompensate by moving en masse to the other route.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - Anticipate a shift from O-L-D to O-R-D by other participants as they seek to avoid the high costs seen on O-L-D.
   - Choosing the least crowded route from the previous round (O-R-D) would likely minimize travel costs.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Opting for route O-R-D should present a lower cost opportunity as many drivers may shift from O-L-D due to last round's high congestion.

Using these insights, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

   - Your payoff was 40.
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost
     - Therefore, Travel Cost = 400 - 40 = 360, confirming you chose route O-R-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-R-D was congested, resulting in a high cost of 360.
   - Route O-L-D had fewer drivers, leading to a lower cost of 240.
   - A notable pattern is emerging where players tend to shift significantly between the two routes, indicating a reactionary pattern.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - Given the congestion on O-R-D, it’s likely that many drivers will switch to O-L-D to avoid the high costs experienced on O-R-D last round.
   - Observing this pattern, there's a typical behavioral shift where participants tend to overcorrect by switching en masse to the other route.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - Expecting many drivers to react to last round's high congestion by moving from O-R-D to O-L-D.
   - To capitalize on this potential shift, moving to O-R-D could present a cost advantage this round.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Opting for O-R-D is logical, assuming other drivers shift their choice based on previous costs, as the current pattern suggests.

Based on this analysis, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

     - Cost for O-L-D = 10 * 16 + 210 = 370.
   - **Route O-R-D**: 2 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-R-D = 210 + 10 * 2 = 230.
   - Your payoff was 170.
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost
     - Therefore, Travel Cost = 400 - 170 = 230, confirming you chose route O-R-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-L-D became extremely congested, leading to a very high cost of 370.
   - Route O-R-D had significantly fewer drivers, resulting in a much lower cost of 230.
   - Players moved heavily to O-L-D, underestimating the potential shift and resulting in high congestion.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - With such heavy congestion on O-L-D, many drivers will likely switch to O-R-D to avoid the high costs experienced on O-L-D.
   - Considering the pattern, participants seem to overcommit to the less used route from the previous round.
   - There's a tendency for major shifts, and understanding this pattern can allow for strategic positioning.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - It's probable that several drivers will switch away from O-L-D to O-R-D based on last round’s costs.
   - The goal is to balance by taking a route currently poised to minimize cost, expecting shifts due to participants responding strongly to feedback.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the expected shift and historical behavior, opting for O-R-D again might maximize payoff if others flood O-L-D.

Based on the analysis, for this round, the decision is:

   - Route O-L-D had only one driver, leading to a relatively minimal cost of 220.
   - Players drastically shifted to O-R-D, causing significant congestion and high costs.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - With such extreme congestion on O-R-D, it's almost certain that many drivers will switch to O-L-D to avoid the high costs.
   - Participants tend to overcompensate when reacting to the previous round's congestion, heavily switching to the other route.
   - Recognizing this pattern, a strategic choice minimizes cost by anticipating these shifts.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - Expect a significant number of drivers to move away from O-R-D to O-L-D due to high costs experienced last round.
   - The goal is to select the traditionally less chosen route, expecting a balance shift due to collective player reaction to previous costs.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Opting for route O-L-D seems strategic as it is likely to be chosen by fewer drivers given the heavy congestion on O-R-D in the last round.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the decision for this round is:

   - Your payoff was 40.
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost
     - Therefore, Travel Cost = 400 - 40 = 360, confirming you chose route O-L-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-L-D was heavily congested, leading to a high travel cost of 360.
   - Route O-R-D had significantly fewer drivers, resulting in a lower cost of 240.
   - The pattern observed shows drivers tend to switch routes en masse after experiencing high costs, resulting in oscillations.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - Given the heavy congestion on O-L-D, many drivers are likely to switch to O-R-D.
   - Observing driver behavior from past rounds, participants seem to react strongly by overcompensating for previous high costs.
   - By anticipating this shift, we can strategically position ourselves to minimize travel costs.

4. **Decision-Making**:

   - **Route O-L-D**: 2 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-L-D = 10 * 2 + 210 = 230.
   - **Route O-R-D**: 16 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-R-D = 210 + 10 * 16 = 370.
   - Your payoff was 30.
     - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost
     - Therefore, Travel Cost = 400 - 30 = 370, confirming you chose route O-R-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-R-D was highly congested with a resulting high cost of 370.
   - Route O-L-D had minimal congestion with a much lower cost of 230.
   - There is a noticeable trend where drivers migrate heavily to one route after seeing it was previously less chosen, leading to congestion on that route.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - Given the severe congestion on O-R-D, there is an expected shift of drivers to O-L-D to avoid the high costs.
   - Historical patterns suggest drivers often react to congestion by switching en masse to the route with fewer drivers.
   - Knowing this behavioral tendency allows us to select a less congested route strategically.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - Anticipate a significant number of drivers will switch from O-R-D to O-L-D after last round's high congestion.
   - Therefore, selecting O-L-D could offer a strategic advantage with potentially lower congestion.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Opting for route O-L-D is strategic, as it anticipates reduced congestion due to participants likely shifting routes to avoid previous high costs.

With these considerations in mind, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

   - Therefore, selecting O-R-D should strategically minimize travel costs due to anticipated lower congestion.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Opting for route O-R-D is sensible, aligning with the expected player movement away from the congested O-L-D.

Based on these considerations, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 2, 'O-R-D': 16}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a strategic decision for this round, let's analyze the past rounds and predict the behavior of other drivers:

1. **Review of Last Round**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 2 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-L-D = 10 * 2 + 210 = 230.
   - **Route O-R-D**: 16 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost for O-R-D = 210 + 10 * 16 = 370.
   - Your payoff was 30.
     - Travel Cost = 400 - 30 = 370, confirming you chose route O-R-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-R-D was heavily congested, resulting in high costs.
   - Route O-L-D was lightly traveled, leading to a lower travel cost.
   - Historically, players tend to switch en masse to avoid congestion, leading to an overcorrection the next round.

3. **Strategic Considerations for This Round**:
   - Given the high cost on O-R-D, many drivers will likely switch to O-L-D this time.
   - Players react to the high cost they incur by moving towards the less congested route from the previous round.
   - Anticipating this switch allows for selecting the route expected to have lower congestion.

4. **Decision-Making**:
   - Predict a substantial shift from O-R-D to O-L-D due to the previous round's congestion and costs.
   - Opting for O-L-D should reduce potential congestion costs and improve your payoff.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Choosing route O-L-D is strategically sound, expecting many participants to shift away from the congested O-R-D.

Based on this analysis, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To determine the best route for the upcoming round, let's break down each option and consider both historical patterns and strategic implications:

1. **Route Breakdown**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 
     - Cost = 10X + 210, where X is the number of drivers on O-L.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**:
     - Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y, where X is the number of drivers on O-L and Y is the number of drivers on R-D.
   - **Route O-R-D**:
     - Cost = 210 + 10Y, where Y is the number of drivers on R-D.

2. **Strategic Analysis**:
   - **General Observation**: Drivers have often switched en masse to avoid the highly congested routes from previous rounds.
   - Including the new route O-L-R-D provides an option that involves both segments O-L and R-D, with potentially lower costs if segments are not congested.
   - **Balancing Act**: 
     - The strategic choice involves predicting the likely number of drivers on each segment based on past choices and overcorrection patterns.

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - If a large number of drivers decide to switch routes to avoid past congestion, it is likely that the distribution among the three routes will not be balanced.
   - Given the introduction of a new route (O-L-R-D), some drivers might explore it as a new viable option, especially if they see potential to reduce costs.

4. **Decision Points**:
   - With fewer total drivers historically choosing O-L, there is an opportunity for less congestion on O-L and balanced traffic on R-D, potentially making O-L-R-D a strategic option if others distribute among O-L-D and O-R-D.
   - If the trend of avoiding highly congested routes continues, players might mostly choose O-R-D or heavily explore O-L-R-D.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Choosing route O-L-R-D could exploit a potential for lower cost, assuming relatively balanced distribution across options.
   - This choice provides a middle ground, engaging both O-L and R-D, assuming the mass shift might balance out slightly owing to its novelty and potential efficiency.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the decision for this round is to choose the route:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the results from the last round, let's reassess the options and decide strategically for the current round:

1. **Review of Last Round**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 0 drivers.
     - No cost, as it was not chosen.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**: 16 drivers.
     - Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y, where both X and Y were 16.
     - Given the congestion, the cost was significant.
   - **Route O-R-D**: 2 drivers.
     - Cost = 210 + 10Y = 210 + 10 * 2 = 230.

2. **Understanding Payoff**:
   - Your payoff was 60, so your cost was 400 - 60 = 340. 
   - Given your result and the previous round's setup, you most likely chose route O-L-R-D, leading to a high congestion cost.

3. **Strategic Analysis for This Round**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: With no drivers previous round, it's underused and could offer lower costs given the historical overreaction pattern.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**: Given the high congestion previously, many drivers might look to switch away from it to reduce costs.
   - **Route O-R-D**: This route remained lightly chosen with low congestion; drivers might shift here, anticipating previous lower costs.

4. **Predicted Driver Behavior**:
   - Drivers will possibly switch to O-L-D or maintain/switch to O-R-D in response to the congestion experienced on O-L-R-D.
   - Assuming a redistributive shift, O-L-D has potential as a less congested choice if drivers move from O-L-R-D fearing the high cost incurred.

5. **Decision Points**:
   - Consider choosing O-L-D; with zero congestion from the previous round, it may attract less attention and fewer drivers switching.
   - O-L-D provides a strategic counterbalance if others predominantly choose O-L-R-D or switch to O-R-D.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Opting for O-L-D is strategic based on its underuse last round, likely yielding lower costs amid the redistribution of drivers.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 13, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 5}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the outcomes from the last round, let's evaluate our options and choose the most strategic route for this round:

1. **Review of Last Round**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 13 drivers.
     - Cost = 10 * 13 + 210 = 340.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**: 0 drivers.
     - No cost as it was not chosen by anyone.
   - **Route O-R-D**: 5 drivers.
     - Cost = 210 + 10 * 5 = 260.

2. **Understanding Payoff**:
   - Your payoff was 60, indicating a higher cost compared to the starting endowment. Most likely, you chose route O-L-D due to higher costs, given its congestion.

3. **Strategic Analysis for This Round**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: Heavy congestion last round; likely to face a decrease in number if players adjust to avoid high costs.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**: Completely unchosen last round; potential for lower cost if a moderate number switch here.
   - **Route O-R-D**: Less congested last time, though players may turn to this route anticipating continued lower costs.

4. **Predicted Driver Behavior**:
   - Drivers who experienced high costs on O-L-D may switch away, diversifying choices between O-L-R-D and O-R-D.
   - O-L-R-D’s complete lack of use last round might attract drivers hoping to avoid congestion costs elsewhere.

5. **Decision Points**:
   - Consider selecting O-L-R-D; it presents the possibility of less congestion if enough players shift away from O-L-D to balance choices.
   - O-L-R-D this time offers a unique opportunity due to its lack of use previously, suggesting less immediate likelihood of congestion.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Opting for O-L-R-D is advantageous, predicting a spread of drivers across routes and low initial chance of congestion.

Given these insights, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 70

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']

1. **Review of Last Round**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 0 drivers.
     - No cost incurred as it was not chosen.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**: 15 drivers.
     - Cost = 10X + 10Y = 10 * 15 + 10 * 15 = 300, where both X (O-L) and Y (R-D) were heavily used.
   - **Route O-R-D**: 3 drivers.
     - Cost = 210 + 10 * 3 = 240.

2. **Understanding Payoff**:
   - Your payoff was 70, indicating a lower cost than the round before.
   - Most likely you chose O-R-D for the last round, given the lower congestion compared to O-L-R-D.

3. **Strategic Analysis for This Round**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: Completely unused last round, which often means potential for less congestion and lower costs.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**: Experienced heavy congestion last round; likely to see some drivers exit this round due to high costs.
   - **Route O-R-D**: Least congested last round, participants might continue using it due to low previous cost.

4. **Predicted Driver Behavior**:
   - Players from O-L-R-D might shift to either O-L-D or continue with O-R-D, seeking lower costs.
   - Given O-L-D was unused, players might flock there anticipating low congestion, except those who perceive it as risky.

5. **Decision Points**:
   - **O-L-D** is an interesting choice if it remains underused or not heavily targeted by others shifting away from O-L-R-D.
   - Continuing with **O-R-D** could also be beneficial if many leave O-L-R-D and still avoid O-L-D due to pattern recognition.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the low usage of O-L-D last round, selecting it could be advantageous for low congestion if the migration from O-L-R-D is not excessive.

Therefore, considering the analysis, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}

   - **Route O-L-R-D**: Completely unused; potential for minimal congestion if not heavily targeted by everyone shifting.
   - **Route O-R-D**: Minimal drivers and cost last round, could remain attractive or get more attention as others try to avoid O-L-D.

4. **Predicted Driver Behavior**:
   - Many drivers will likely shift away from O-L-D due to high congestion seen last round.
   - O-L-R-D's complete lack of use may attract drivers hoping to avoid congestion seen on O-L-D.
   - O-R-D might maintain attractiveness if drivers believe it continues to yield lower costs.

5. **Decision Points**:
   - Selecting **O-L-R-D** seems strategic, given its total non-use last round and the opportunity for low cost if driver distribution is balanced.
   - It offers a middle-ground option leveraging both segments underused in past rounds and possible lower costs.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Choosing O-L-R-D is a reasonable strategy, based on expected driver shifts from O-L-D and its underutilization.

Given this analysis, the decision for this round is:

   - **Route O-L-R-D**: Completely unused, making it a potentially attractive option if others shift away from O-L-D.
   - **Route O-R-D**: Identically unused, signaling a potential for low congestion and cost.

4. **Predicted Driver Behavior**:
   - Many drivers will likely shift away from O-L-D in search of lower costs, diversifying between O-L-R-D and O-R-D.
   - Given the complete non-use of both O-L-R-D and O-R-D last round, drivers might equally distribute across them or gravitate to one more than the other.

5. **Decision Points**:
   - Selecting **O-L-R-D** might be strategic, as it allows utilization of both segments with potentially balanced costs if drivers are moving evenly.
   - Alternatively, **O-R-D** could offer a straightforward, potentially less congested path given its zero use.

   - **Route O-L-R-D**: Very few players used, hinting at low congestion, but may attract those avoiding O-R-D.
   - **Route O-R-D**: Heavy congestion last round will likely push players away from it to avoid similar high costs.

4. **Predicted Driver Behavior**:
   - Players are likely to move away from O-R-D to avoid congestion, potentially balancing between O-L-D and O-L-R-D.
   - O-L-D appears most attractive due to its complete non-use last round; many could be drawn to it, however, overly large shifts could still cause congestion.

5. **Decision Points**:
   - **O-L-D**: Presents an opportunity for low congestion costs if the switch is not overwhelming.
   - **O-L-R-D**: Offers an alternate route, potentially balancing congestion if drivers diversify their choices.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Opting for route O-L-D appears optimal, particularly as it was not used last time, suggesting initially low congestion, provided not all players decide the same.

Based on this strategic analysis, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 18, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 0}
Your payoff was 10

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To determine the best route for this round, we need to analyze the previous outcomes and anticipate how players might adjust their choices:

1. **Review of Last Round**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 18 drivers.
     - Cost = 10 * 18 + 210 = 390, indicating very high congestion and cost.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**: 0 drivers.
     - No congestion, potential for lower costs if selected, assuming not everyone switches to it.
   - **Route O-R-D**: 0 drivers.
     - No congestion here as well, offering the same potential for low cost if selected wisely.

2. **Understanding Your Payoff**:
   - Your payoff was 10, reflecting a very high cost due to the dense congestion on O-L-D, thus indicating the necessity to pivot from this highly congested route.

3. **Strategic Analysis for This Round**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: Given the extreme congestion last round, it is likely that players will avoid this route in the current round.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**: Unused last time, is attractive for those seeking minimal congestion, but its appeal could draw significant interest, potentially leading to overuse.
   - **Route O-R-D**: Another completely unused route, offering the potential for low congestion costs. Similar to O-L-R-D, there's a risk of everyone switching to it.

4. **Predicted Driver Behavior**:
   - A considerable number of players will likely seek alternatives to O-L-D due to the high cost they faced.
   - Drivers might be evenly split between O-L-R-D and O-R-D to exploit their previous non-use, trying to minimize travel costs.

5. **Decision Points**:
   - Opting for **O-L-R-D** or **O-R-D** both seem advantageous given their unused status last round. The decision hinges on anticipating how others will split their choices between the two.
   - If you anticipate that more will switch to O-R-D, choosing O-L-R-D becomes wise, and vice-versa.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Choosing O-L-R-D may prove beneficial if expecting the majority of players to avoid O-L-D but still trying to spread across different routes for balance.

Based on this strategic thought process, the decision for the current round is:
