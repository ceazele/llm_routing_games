System: 
You're Michael Brown, a 45-year-old doctor.
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you’ll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 5 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O A B D
Edges and associated costs:
Edge O to A, cost function: 10 * X
Edge O to B, cost function: 210
Edge A to D, cost function: 210
Edge A to B, cost function: 0
Edge B to D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-A-D', 'O-A-B-D', 'O-B-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-A-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-A to travel from O to A plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment A-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-B-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment B-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-A and B-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments A-D and O-B is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point S at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-A-B-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-A-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-B-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 X 4) + 0 + (10 X 15) = 190.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-A and 15 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment B-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-A-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 X 4) + (210) = 250, and each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-B-D will be charged a travel cost of (210) + (10 X 15) = 360.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 5 rounds have exactly the same structure.


Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-A-B-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Based on the information and the schema provided, here is a well-formatted JSON instance that specifies the choice of route:

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-B-D"
}
```

In this instance, the chosen route is 'O-A-B-D'.

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 15, 'O-A-B-D': 2, 'O-B-D': 1}
Your cost was 200

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-A-B-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the information and the JSON schema, it's important to choose a route that potentially minimizes the cost based on last round's distribution. Evaluating last round:

- 'O-A-D' had 15 players, making its cost approximately \(10 \times 15 + 210 = 360\).
- 'O-A-B-D' had 2 players, making its cost approximately \(10 \times 2 + 0 + 10 \times 1 = 20 + 10 = 30\).
- 'O-B-D' had 1 player, making its cost approximately \(10 \times 1 + 210 = 220\).

Since the target is to minimize costs, 'O-A-B-D' seems to be a better choice based on the previous round's player distribution.

Here is the JSON object reflecting that choice:

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-B-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 0, 'O-A-B-D': 12, 'O-B-D': 6}
Your cost was 300

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-A-B-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the information from the last round and the JSON schema, let's evaluate the routes again:

- For 'O-A-D': It had 0 players last round, so the cost would have been \(10 \times 0 + 210 = 210\).
- For 'O-A-B-D': It had 12 players last round, so the cost would have been \(10 \times 12 + 0 + 10 \times 6 = 120 + 60 = 180\).
- For 'O-B-D': It had 6 players last round, so the cost would have been \(210 + 10 \times 6 = 270\).

Given these costs, 'O-A-B-D' still seems to be the route with a potentially lower cost next round, though it had higher participation than 'O-A-D'.

Here is the JSON object reflecting the choice of the route:

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-B-D"
}
```

Given the potential fluctuations and assuming that the participation patterns may not change drastically, 'O-A-B-D' still holds promise. However, noticing the minimal traffic on 'O-A-D', another strategy could be to choose 'O-A-D' to potentially benefit from its current low-traffic advantage given that others might choose differently. If you decide precision targeting based on last round isn't working as expected, adopting 'O-A-D' could optimize your costs:

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Strategically, the final choice could align with opting for 'O-A-D' given the nature of low traffic reported previously.

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 17, 'O-A-B-D': 1, 'O-B-D': 0}
Your cost was 190

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-A-B-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the information from the last round and the JSON schema, let's evaluate the routes:

- For 'O-A-D': The cost for 17 players would have been \(10 \times 17 + 210 = 380\).
- For 'O-A-B-D': The cost for 1 player would have been \(10 \times 1 + 0 + 10 \times 0 = 10\).
- For 'O-B-D': The cost for 0 players would have been \(210 + 10 \times 0 = 210\).

Given these costs, the route 'O-A-B-D' had the lowest cost last round, potentially suggesting many will switch to it next round given that pattern. Following this analysis, here’s the JSON object reflecting a calculated choice for the least congested route potentially next round:

```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

Alternatively, another strategic choice might be opting for 'O-A-B-D' expecting potentially fewer players this coming round if others believe it will be congested.
 
Here’s an alternate JSON format reflecting such choice:

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-B-D"
}
```

The decision focuses on anticipating other players potentially avoiding previously high-cost routes. In terms of adjustment strategy, 'O-B-D' features minimal recent congestion.

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 0, 'O-A-B-D': 3, 'O-B-D': 15}
Your cost was 390

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-A-B-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the information from the last round and the JSON schema, let's evaluate the potential costs for the upcoming round:

- For 'O-A-D': The cost for 0 players would have been \(10 \times 0 + 210 = 210\).
- For 'O-A-B-D': The cost for 3 players would have been \(10 \times 3 + 0 + 10 \times 15 = 30 + 150 = 180\).
- For 'O-B-D': The cost for 15 players would have been \(210 + 10 \times 15 = 360\).

Based on this evaluation, 'O-A-D' had a minimal cost due to zero players last round, suggesting it might be a safer choice this time compared to the others.

Here’s the JSON object that reflects this decision:

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Given the strategic assessment, 'O-A-D' may offer a lower-cost route, anticipating that player distribution might favor 'O-A-B-D' or 'O-B-D', depending on their congestion experiences last round.
