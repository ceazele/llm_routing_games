System Message:

You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 x X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 x X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

LLM Outputs:
Round 1:
To make an informed decision, let's break down the problem and evaluate both potential routes:

1. **Understanding the Costs for Each Segment**:
   - Route **O-L-D**: The cost is dynamic based on how many drivers (let's call it `X`) choose this route. The formula for the cost is `10X + 210`.
   - Route **O-R-D**: The fixed cost is `210`, plus a dynamic cost contingent on how many drivers (let's call it `Y`) choose this route. The formula for the cost is `210 + 10Y`.

2. **Target**:
   - Our goal is to minimize the cost and maximize the payoff, which is calculated as: `Payoff = Endowment - Travel Cost`.
   - With an endowment of 400 points, our focus is to minimize the travel cost associated with our route choice.

3. **Initial Assumption**:
   - Assume that all drivers are rational and have the same information. Therefore, there's a chance many drivers would pick the perceived optimal route to minimize their cost.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - If everyone chooses **O-L-D**, the cost can escalate quickly because the cost on segment O-L is dependent on the number of drivers.
   - If everyone chooses **O-R-D**, similarly, the cost can go up due to the segment R-D being dynamic in cost.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - With no prior information on how other drivers will choose in round 1, we should attempt to predict the choice of blend between choosing a route likely to be less crowded and potential payoff.
   - A balanced conservative choice might lean towards `O-R-D`, as the starting segment cost is fixed, potentially reducing the risk of higher costs if many other drivers choose an unpredictable route.

Given these considerations and the symmetry in structure, I'll choose a route that seems potentially less impacted by the actions of others initially. Here's the format decision:

```json
{
  "route": "O-R-D"
}
```

Round 2:
To make an informed decision for round 2, I will consider the following factors:

1. **Previous Round Details**: 
   - I chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 100.
   - The distribution of agents was even: 9 agents on O-L-D and 9 agents on O-R-D.

2. **Payoff Calculation**:
   - The formula for calculating the travel cost is critical: 
     - For O-L-D: Cost = 10X + 210
     - For O-R-D: Cost = 210 + 10Y
   - Given 9 agents on each route, both would result in:
     - O-L-D: Cost = 10(9) + 210 = 300, thus payoff = 400 - 300 = 100
     - O-R-D: Cost = 10(9) + 210 = 300, thus payoff = 100

3. **Observation**:
   - The routes were evenly split between agents, resulting in the same payoff for both routes.
   - The goal is to minimize the cost and maximize the payoff by potentially choosing the less crowded route.

4. **Potential Strategies**:
   - If other agents also analyze the situation, they might gravitate towards choosing one route over the other in the upcoming round to improve their payoffs.
   - Switching to O-L-D could be beneficial if the majority chooses to remain on O-R-D to avoid congestion, lowering X on O-L-D and thus the cost.

5. **Conclusion for Round 2 Choice**:
   - Given the symmetry in round 1 and the potential for other agents to stay on their current route, I will switch to O-L-D with the expectation that fewer might choose it, or at worst, expect the same scenario as round 1.

Based on the above analysis, the chosen route for round 2 will be O-L-D.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 3:
To make an informed decision for round 3, let's analyze the previous rounds and the potential outcomes:

1. **Objective**: The objective is to maximize the payoff by minimizing travel costs. The initial endowment is 400 points, and the costs for each route depend on the number of agents choosing each segment as well as the fixed costs.

2. **Cost Functions**:
   - Route O-L-D: Cost = 10 * X + 210, where X is the number of participants choosing the O-L segment.
   - Route O-R-D: Cost = 210 + 10 * Y, where Y is the number of participants choosing the R-D segment.

3. **Previous Rounds Summary**:
   - **Round 1**: 
     - Chose O-R-D, 9 agents per route.
     - Payoff: 100 (Cost = 400 - 100 = 300)
     - Cost calculation: 210 (fixed) + 90 (10 * 9) = 300
   - **Round 2**: 
     - Chose O-L-D, 6 agents on O-L-D, 12 agents on O-R-D.
     - Payoff: 130 (Cost = 400 - 130 = 270)
     - Cost calculation: 10 * 6 + 210 = 270

4. **Analyzing Strategies**:
   - **Round 1 Analysis**: 
     - Both routes ended up with equal distribution (9 agents each), making the cost high for both. 
   - **Round 2 Analysis**:
     - More agents chose O-R-D (12), resulting in a cost of 210 + 120 = 330.
     - Fewer agents on O-L-D (6), resulted in a lower cost of 270 on that route.

5. **Prediction for Round 3**:
   - The trend suggests agents are responsive to the costs they experience.
   - Given the higher cost on O-R-D in Round 2, some agents are likely to switch to O-L-D to reduce costs, as I did.
   - If people switch to O-L-D anticipating lower costs, it might balance out or even overcrowd O-L-D, increasing costs.

6. **Decision Making**:
   - To maximize the payoff, it's crucial to choose a route with fewer agents.
   - Since Round 2 favored O-L-D, some agents may stay or switch based on their experience.
   - Slightly more agents could choose O-L-D this round, suggesting it may become more crowded.
   - Given this, I will choose route O-R-D for Round 3 because there’s potential it could have fewer agents as others might switch away from it.

Thus, the choice for round 3 is based on anticipating fewer agents on O-R-D after observing trends from the previous rounds.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 4:
In round 4, we need to choose between the two routes: O-L-D and O-R-D. To make a strategic decision, let's analyze the provided data and think through our options:

1. **Round 1 Analysis**:
   - Route Distribution: 
     - O-L-D: 9 agents
     - O-R-D: 9 agents
   - Outcome: Chose O-R-D, payoff = 100, indicating total cost was 300.
   - Implication: Both routes had high traffic, leading to 270 cost on O-L-D as well.

2. **Round 2 Analysis**:
   - Route Distribution:
     - O-L-D: 6 agents
     - O-R-D: 12 agents
   - Outcome: Chose O-L-D, payoff = 130, indicating total cost was 270.
   - Implication: Fewer agents on O-L-D resulted in lower cost compared to O-R-D.

3. **Round 3 Analysis**:
   - Route Distribution:
     - O-L-D: 17 agents
     - O-R-D: 1 agent
   - Outcome: Chose O-R-D, payoff = 180, indicating total cost was 220.
   - Implication: Substantial reduction in agents on O-R-D, maximizing payoff.

**Decision Making for Round 4**:

- We've observed that agents tend to switch routes when costs vary significantly.
- Round 3 had a substantially higher traffic on O-L-D leading to very high costs for those choosing it.
- Given the past pattern, it's reasonable to predict that drivers who faced high costs in Round 3 due to choosing the crowded O-L-D route may switch to O-R-D in Round 4.
- To maximize payoff, it's prudent to minimize traffic jams on our chosen route. An optimal strategy is to infer popular turn-offs based on recent round outcomes.
  
Based on this pattern, it's likely that some of the 17 agents from Round 3 might transition to O-R-D in the current round, but starting from an overcrowded baseline. We need to anticipate potentially high traffic if too many agents attempt to switch back simultaneously.

Therefore, anticipating potential framing choices by others into O-R-D, a strategy to maintain lower simultaneous overlaps suggests that we choose route O-R-D again given it's likely less congested compared to others oscillating already.

Here's the strategically decided choice:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 5:
To make an informed choice for round 5, let's analyze the outcomes from the previous four rounds and identify patterns or trends:

1. **Round 1**: 
   - Chose route O-R-D with 9 agents on each route.
   - Payoff was 100. 
   - Cost calculation: O-R-D cost = 210 + 10 x 9 = 210 + 90 = 300.
   - Payoff was 400 - 300 = 100.
   
2. **Round 2**:
   - Chose route O-L-D with 6 agents on O-L-D and 12 on O-R-D.
   - Payoff was 130.
   - Cost calculation: O-L-D cost = 10 x 6 + 210 = 60 + 210 = 270.
   - Payoff was 400 - 270 = 130.

3. **Round 3**:
   - Chose route O-R-D with 17 agents on O-L-D and 1 on O-R-D.
   - Payoff was 180.
   - Cost calculation: O-R-D cost = 210 + 10 x 1 = 220.
   - Payoff was 400 - 220 = 180.

4. **Round 4**:
   - Chose route O-R-D with 0 agents on O-L-D and 18 on O-R-D.
   - Payoff was 10.
   - Cost calculation: O-R-D cost = 210 + 10 x 18 = 390.
   - Payoff was 400 - 390 = 10.

**Analysis**:
- Opting for route O-R-D generally results in lower costs when fewer agents choose that same route.
- Chose O-R-D twice and received relatively low payoffs when several agents also picked O-R-D.
- Choosing O-L-D in round 2 yielded a better payoff of 130 due to a balanced number of drivers on each path.

**Current Decision for Round 5**:
Based on past rounds:
- Route O-L-D had a higher payoff in round 2 even with 6 agents on it due to fewer agents compared to 12 on O-R-D.
- In round 3, with 1 agent on O-R-D, the payoff increased significantly.
- In round 4, where all agents chose O-R-D, the payoff was extremely low.
- A possible strategy is to anticipate a shift back to O-L-D due to the low payoff from 18 agents on O-R-D in round 4.

Thus, the optimal choice for round 5 to potentially balance the routes and maximize payoff seems to be choosing route O-L-D.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 6:
To make the decision, let's analyze the previous rounds:

- **Round 1:** Equal distribution of agents on both routes resulted in a low payoff when choosing O-R-D.
- **Round 2:** Choosing O-L-D with fewer agents resulted in a better payoff.
- **Round 3:** The O-R-D route had only 1 agent (myself), leading to a high payoff, indicating fewer agents result in better outcomes.
- **Round 4:** All agents chose O-R-D, leading to the lowest possible payoff, reinforcing that a crowded route is unfavorable.
- **Round 5:** Fewer agents were on O-R-D compared to O-L-D, but O-L-D was chosen and resulted in a moderate payoff, suggesting a slight bias towards fewer agents despite overall high numbers on O-L-D.

Key Observations:
1. High payoff occurs when you choose less crowded routes.
2. The previous rounds reveal fluctuating choices among participants, with both routes becoming equally undesirable at times.
3. A strategic shift by participants results in sudden preference changes from one route to the other.
4. The last round favored fewer participants on O-R-D.

Decision Strategy:
- Avoid crowded routes by selecting the less populated route.
- Based on the pattern, after each extreme distribution, agents tend to shift their preference to the opposite route.
- Predict a potential switch of agents potentially heading towards O-L-D, due to the dissatisfaction derived from large numbers on O-L-D in the previous round.

Taking the above analysis into account, the optimal choice would likely be the less populated route, which might now be O-R-D due to the fluctuation in agent distribution.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 7:
Let's start by analyzing the data from the previous rounds to make an informed decision for round 7.

Understanding the Cost Structure:
1. Route O-L-D: Cost is 10X + 210.
2. Route O-R-D: Cost is 210 + 10Y.

To maximize our payoff, we need to minimize the cost. This implies choosing the route with fewer participants.

Reviewing the Previous Rounds:
- Round 1: Both routes had 9 agents each, resulting in equal costs. 
- Round 2: O-L-D had fewer agents (6), resulting in a higher payoff for choosing it.
- Round 3: O-R-D had just 1 agent (including me), resulting in the highest payoff so far.
- Round 4: O-L-D had no agents, but I still chose O-R-D, resulting in a very low payoff.
- Round 5: O-R-D had fewer agents (5), but I chose O-L-D with 13 agents, incurring a higher cost.
- Round 6: I chose O-R-D with 11 agents, but O-L-D had fewer, causing a moderate payoff.

Strategy for Round 7:
Given the pattern, participants seem to switch after a few rounds from one route to another. O-R-D seems to attract more participants as more people switch to what seems to be less crowded from their previous experiences. 

Predictably, after round 6, route O-L-D might have fewer participants since O-R-D had more in round 6. This would mean a shift towards O-L-D is likely for those seeking lower costs.

Decision:
Based on the pattern, I should go for route O-L-D, anticipating that it will have fewer participants in round 7.

Let's format this decision in the required JSON format:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 8:
To decide which route to choose for round 8, let's analyze the information from the previous rounds:

1. **Past Payoffs and Decisions**:
    - The payoff is higher when fewer agents choose the same route as you because this lowers the variable cost component related to the number of drivers on shared segments.
    - The highest payoff previously was 180, which occurred when only 1 agent, including myself, chose the O-R-D route.

2. **Previous Rounds Analysis**:
    - Round 1: Both routes were evenly split (9-9), resulting in a payoff of 100, which is relatively low.
    - Round 2: Choosing O-L-D resulted in a better payoff (130) compared to a balance (100). Majority were on O-R-D.
    - Round 3: Significantly fewer agents on O-R-D led to a high payoff (180). Majority were on O-L-D.
    - Round 4: High congestion on your chosen route O-R-D led to the lowest payoff (10).
    - Round 5: O-L-D saw a high number of agents, resulting in a low payoff (60).
    - Round 6: More agents again on O-R-D, leading to a modest payoff (80).
    - Round 7: Near balance, but choosing O-L-D yielded a better outcome (110).

3. **Decision Strategy**:
    - Alternating between routes and the subsequent behavior of other agents suggest a fluctuation in congestion.
    - Recent round shows balance is detrimental since outcomes were better when choosing the least congested route from the last round.

4. **Making a Decision**:
    - Since in round 7, agents were evenly split but leaning slightly towards O-R-D (10 agents), there’s a possibility that agents noticing the balance might choose to shift back to O-L-D.
    - Overall, based on the pattern, it would be strategic to anticipate that other agents might go back to O-L-D if they think others will stay on O-R-D.
    - Predicting the behavior could indicate that O-R-D may experience less congestion this round after a relatively balanced previous round.

Based on this reasoning, it could be advantageous to choose the O-R-D route.

**Chosen Route**: O-R-D

Here's the JSON output:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 9:
To determine the optimal route for Round 9, let's analyze the previous rounds' data and assess the outcomes based on the number of agents and payoffs:

1. **Observation of Past Rounds:**
   - Choosing **O-R-D**, I've received payoffs of 100, 180, 10, 80, and 60.
   - Choosing **O-L-D**, I've received payoffs of 130, 60, and 110.

2. **Key Insights:**
   - A higher number of agents on a route results in higher costs. Hence, paying attention to previous patterns on how agents distribute can impact my decision.
   - The highest payoff on O-R-D was when I was the only agent (Round 3), resulting in the lowest cost.
   - Conversely, the lowest payoff on O-R-D was when all agents, including me, chose that route (Round 4).
   - Similarly, the payoff is generally better on a less crowded route, such as O-L-D with fewer agents.

3. **Analyzing Trends:**
   - Rounds 1, 7, and 8 show a fairly balanced agent distribution between routes. 
   - The pattern seems to reflect a fluctuating choice between the two routes by other drivers.

4. **Strategic Decision:**
   - Attempting to anticipate the decision of others can be risky due to the independent nature of decisions. 
   - However, reacting to past distribution suggests that after a high concentration of agents on one route, there might be a shift to the other route in subsequent rounds.

5. **Decision for Round 9:**
   - Considering previous fluctuations and aiming for a higher payoff, I am leaning toward choosing the route that typically had fewer agents or where agents might shift to another route due to past congestion.
   - Since rounds seldom repeat identical distributions, and given that last round O-R-D was more populated, switching to O-L-D may present a more balanced cost opportunity.

Based on the analysis, the strategic choice for Round 9 is to choose route **O-L-D**. Here's the formatted output:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 10:
To decide on the route for round 10, we should analyze the outcomes from previous rounds to predict how many agents might choose each route, which directly affects our travel costs and payoff.

Here's a brief analysis of the past rounds:

- **Route O-L-D:**
  - Generally seems more favorable when less than 9 agents choose it (payoffs ≥ 130 points in rounds 2 and 3).
  - Payoffs were very low (60 and 40) when a large number of agents (13+ and 15) chose this route (rounds 5 and 9).

- **Route O-R-D:**
  - Had a good payoff (180) when almost all other agents chose the alternative route (round 3).
  - Results were poor to acceptable (10, 60, 80) when 11 or more agents opted for this route (rounds 4, 8, and 6).

**Trends:**
- Route switches between rounds indicate agents are reacting to costs from previous rounds.
- Higher costs on O-L-D suggest agents might switch to O-R-D in the following round to optimize their payoffs.

**Route choice for Round 10:**
- Analyzing patterns, round 9 had high congestion on O-L-D, so it is likely some agents will switch to O-R-D in round 10.
- Considering the needs to maximize payoffs and the agents potentially switching, I predict it's still relatively safer to choose route O-R-D because while it might attract more people, it could still balance out around 8-10 agents per route.

With these considerations in mind, here's the JSON formatted choice:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 11:
To decide which route to choose for round 11, let's analyze the previous rounds and attempt to predict the expected distribution of drivers.

1. **Analyze Previous Patterns:**
   - We have data from 10 rounds. Analyzing the distribution of agents on the routes over these rounds can help us detect a trend.
   - It seems that neither route consistently dominates, but in each round, one route gains more agents, indicating an oscillation pattern.

2. **Past Data Summary:**
   - O-L-D: The number of drivers has varied between 0 and 15.
   - O-R-D: The number of drivers has varied between 1 and 18.

3. **Payoff Analysis:**
   - The highest payoffs (180, 130) occurred when there was a significant imbalance between the chosen route and the alternative route's driver count.
   - Moderate payoffs (around 80-110) occurred with a more balanced distribution.

4. **Predicting Next Round:**
   - If we examine the last few rounds:
     - Rounds 8 and 10 are similar, with more agents taking O-R-D, resulting in moderate payoffs on that route.
     - Given the tendency to oscillate and switch, drivers might now switch back to balancing. This means a slight shift toward more drivers on O-L-D could be expected.
   
5. **Decision Making:**
   - Based on the expectation that after a round with more drivers on O-R-D, drivers may switch to O-L-D this round, there is a risk that O-L-D might get overloaded like round 9.
   - However, the risk on O-L-D seems somewhat mitigated because of the detected oscillating pattern, suggesting moderate numbers on both routes.

**Strategy: Given these considerations, choosing the route that recently had fewer drivers (O-R-D) could potentially yield a better payoff if more drivers decide to switch again.** 

Here's the formatted JSON based on the decision:

```json
{
  "route": "O-R-D"
}
```

Round 12:
To make a decision for round 12, let's analyze the pattern from previous rounds and the potential outcomes:

1. **Understanding Payoffs:**
   - The fixed endowment is 400 points.
   - The travel cost is subtracted from the endowment to get the payoff.
   - The cost of route O-L-D is calculated as \(10X + 210\).
   - The cost of route O-R-D is calculated as \(210 + 10Y\).

2. **Reviewing Past Decisions:**
   - Rounds where I chose O-R-D:
     - Equal distribution (Round 1): Payoff 100
     - More agents on O-L-D (Rounds 3, 11): Higher payoffs (180, 130)
     - More agents on O-R-D (Rounds 4, 6, 8, 10): Lower payoffs (10, 80, 60, 80)

   - Rounds where I chose O-L-D:
     - More agents on O-R-D (Rounds 2): Higher payoff (130)
     - More agents on O-L-D (Rounds 5, 9): Lower payoffs (60, 40)
     - Balanced distribution (Round 7): Moderate payoff (110)

3. **Identifying Patterns:**
   - Higher payoffs are achieved when fewer agents are on the chosen route.
   - Last round (Round 11) had more agents on O-L-D, resulting in a high payoff for choosing O-R-D.

4. **Choosing Based on Previous Patterns:**
   - Historically, choosing O-R-D tends to offer better payoffs when it has fewer agents.
   - Recent pattern suggests O-L-D is attracting more agents.
   - Participants may alternate their choices trying to avoid larger crowds.

5. **Decision for Round 12:**
   - To maximize the chances of a higher payoff, it would be strategic to choose the route with potentially fewer agents based on recent distributions.
   - Given more agents chose O-L-D in the previous round, I will choose O-R-D to aim for a higher payoff assuming the pattern persists.

Based on this analysis, the decision for round 12 is to choose route O-R-D.

```json
{
  "route": "O-R-D"
}
```

Round 13:
To decide which route to take in round 13, we should analyze the outcomes from previous rounds. The goal is to minimize travel costs and thereby maximize the payoff. Let's consider the following points:

1. **Observation of Patterns:**
   - In rounds where more agents chose O-L-D, (like rounds 4 and 5), the payoff was lower when choosing O-R-D. 
   - Conversely, in rounds where more agents chose O-R-D, (like rounds 3 and 11), there was a higher payoff when choosing O-R-D.

2. **Payoff Trends:**
   - Generally, payoff tends to be larger when the number of competing agents on the chosen route is lower.

3. **Recent Round Outcomes:**
   - In round 12, choosing O-R-D resulted in a payoff of 90, indicating a moderate spread between the two routes (8 for O-L-D and 10 for O-R-D).

4. **Guess for Agent Behavior:**
   - Based on previous trends, there seems to be some oscillation between the routes over the rounds. 
   - Given the moderate results in the previous round, and no extreme imbalance, agents might shift again to try and optimize their own payoffs.

5. **Strategy:**
   - Choosing the route less traveled by others generally helps increase payoff. Since there was a general crowding on O-R-D in the last round (though moderate), it would be strategic to choose O-L-D this round if expecting that others might switch or balance out again.

Given the information above, the strategic choice would be to select the route that is likely to be less crowded. Therefore, for round 13, the choice of route is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 14:
To decide which route to choose for round 14, we need to analyze the results from previous rounds and make a strategic decision based on patterns we observe.

1. **Review of Past Choices and Outcomes:**
   - When more agents choose 'O-R-D', the cost on the R-D segment (which is variable) increases, leading to lower payoffs if 'O-R-D' is crowded.
   - Conversely, when 'O-L-D' is less crowded, it results in a higher payoff due to a lower cost on the L segment.

2. **Identifying Trends:**
   - I received the highest payoff (180) when I chose 'O-R-D' and only 1 participant joined me there, indicating that lower congestion on 'O-R-D' can be very beneficial.
   - High congestion on 'O-R-D' often leads to lower payoffs.
   - Payoffs on 'O-L-D' tend to be moderate unless it becomes too crowded.

3. **Balance of Previous Rounds:**
   - 'O-R-D' has been chosen when it seemed advantageous in terms of perceived lower congestion but fluctuated in payoff based on agent distribution.
   - There appears to be some switching trend between routes as participants adjust to minimize their own costs.

4. **Decision for Round 14:**
   - Given recent distributions where there were instances of higher number of agents on 'O-L-D', it might lead some to switch back to 'O-R-D'.
   - However, 'O-R-D' had 6 agents in one round which seemed like a sweet spot for a decent payoff (e.g., Round 11 payoffs were favorable).

5. **Strategy:**
   - Choose 'O-R-D' with a hope that the number of participants will balance out, leaning towards fewer on 'O-R-D', given recent fluctuations could mean it might not be overly populated this round.

Hence, I will choose route 'O-R-D' for round 14 to potentially achieve a balance between the number of agents and the resulting cost.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 15:
To make an informed decision on which route to choose for round 15, we need to consider the outcomes from the previous rounds and attempt to predict the behavior of the other drivers based on this data.

Here's a summary of the costs for each route:
- Route O-L-D: Cost = 10x (where x is the number of drivers) + 210
- Route O-R-D: Cost = 210 + 10y (where y is the number of drivers)

### Analyzing the Data:
1. **Route Balancing:** 
   - There have been fluctuations between heavily traveled routes and less traveled ones.
   - Typically, a route with fewer drivers tends to yield a higher payoff due to lower variable costs.

2. **Historical Trends:**
   - Payoffs around 60-80 seem common in rounds where the chosen route has 11-13 drivers.
   - Payoffs of around 180 occurred when only 1 player (yourself) traveled on route O-R-D, which is ideal but unlikely to be replicated if all players are making strategic decisions.
   - Payoffs decrease significantly when one route is heavily crowded (as low as 10), suggesting that avoiding overcrowded routes is imperative.

3. **Recent Patterns:**
   - Round 14 ended with 12 agents choosing O-R-D and 6 choosing O-L-D, which might suggest a potential shift if players try to balance costs for the next round.

### Decision Approach:
Based on the trends and trying to anticipate the strategic shifts, a plausible choice would be to select the route that was less popular in the recent round, since players may switch to balance the costs:
- Since O-R-D had more drivers in Round 14, players might shift to O-L-D in Round 15 to seek a better payoff.
- Predicting other players might favor the less populated route, O-L-D may have fewer drivers this time.

Given this reasoning, I would opt for:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 16:
To decide which route to take in round 16, let's analyze the previous rounds' results to identify any patterns or strategies that could maximize the payoff.

1. **Analysis of Past Rounds:**
   - **Route Payoffs:** 
     - O-L-D: Payoffs were 130, 60, 110, 40, 70, 100.
     - O-R-D: Payoffs were 100, 180, 10, 80, 60, 80, 130, 90, 70.
   - **Agent Distribution Impact:**
     - High payoff for O-L-D occurs when fewer agents select it, typically when around 8-9 agents choose this route.
     - High payoff for O-R-D happens when O-R-D is chosen by fewer agents (e.g., 1-3 agents) and tends to be better when the majority is on O-L-D.

2. **Identifying Trends:**
   - **Balanced Rounds (9-9 split):** 
     - Payoffs are moderate (100 for both routes).
   - **Highly Uneven Rounds:**
     - When one route is heavily favored by participants, the other route tends to yield a higher payoff. Example: In Round 3, choosing O-R-D when the majority (17) chose O-L-D resulted in a very high payoff (180).

3. **Strategic Consideration:**
   - Attempt to predict common choice: Previous patterns suggest fluctuating agent choices. Rounds with more agents on O-L-D resulted in better O-R-D payoffs and vice versa.
   - Given the randomness seen in distribution (like in round 4 with all on O-R-D), risk of congestion on both routes exists.
   - **Route choice should ideally be against perceived majority.**

4. **Decision for Round 16:**
   - Considering the volatility and tendency of agents switching routes:
   - It might be beneficial to select the less obvious choice based on alternating patterns from recent rounds. 
   - **Optimally, since Route O-R-D saw more choice recently (likely saturation), I’ll choose O-L-D anticipating many will switch based on their last low payoff knowledge.**

Therefore, the strategy would lead to a choice of O-L-D for potentially higher payoff:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 17:
To determine the route choice for round 17, let's analyze the trends and payoffs from the previous rounds:

1. **Payoff Consideration:**
   - The payoff is calculated as the endowment (400 points) minus travel costs.
   - Travel costs for O-L-D = 10X + 210
   - Travel costs for O-R-D = 210 + 10Y
   - The goal is to maximize the payoff, i.e., minimize the travel costs.

2. **Trends from Previous Rounds:**
   - When O-R-D was chosen:
     - Round 1: Payoff 100 (9 O-L-D, 9 O-R-D)
     - Round 3: Payoff 180 (17 O-L-D, 1 O-R-D)
     - Round 4: Payoff 10 (0 O-L-D, 18 O-R-D)
     - Round 6: Payoff 80 (7 O-L-D, 11 O-R-D)
     - Round 8: Payoff 60 (5 O-L-D, 13 O-R-D)
     - Round 10: Payoff 80 (7 O-L-D, 11 O-R-D)
     - Round 11: Payoff 130 (12 O-L-D, 6 O-R-D)
     - Round 12: Payoff 90 (8 O-L-D, 10 O-R-D)
     - Round 14: Payoff 70 (6 O-L-D, 12 O-R-D)
   
   - When O-L-D was chosen:
     - Round 2: Payoff 130 (6 O-L-D, 12 O-R-D)
     - Round 5: Payoff 60 (13 O-L-D, 5 O-R-D)
     - Round 7: Payoff 110 (8 O-L-D, 10 O-R-D)
     - Round 9: Payoff 40 (15 O-L-D, 3 O-R-D)
     - Round 13: Payoff 70 (12 O-L-D, 6 O-R-D)
     - Round 15: Payoff 100 (9 O-L-D, 9 O-R-D)
     - Round 16: Payoff 90 (10 O-L-D, 8 O-R-D)

3. **Analysis of Situations:**
   - High payoff situations occur when the majority chooses the opposite route.
   - Best payoff scenario for O-R-D was Round 3 (180 payoff), with a very high number of drivers on O-L-D.
   - Best payoff scenario for O-L-D was Round 2 (130 payoff), with more drivers on O-R-D.

4. **Decision for Round 17:**
   - The balancing act appears frequently, with many rounds having close splits but overall slightly more bias towards O-L-D.
   - In recent rounds, the payoffs for O-R-D have generally been higher than those for O-L-D, suggesting a slight trend favorable to O-R-D.
   - Based on recent consistent better outcomes when switching back to O-R-D after an O-L-D choice, O-R-D seems like a favorable option.

Considering these trends and maximizing the expected payoff, let's choose route O-R-D for round 17.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 18:
To decide which route to choose in round 18, let's analyze the patterns observed in earlier rounds. The key is to find a pattern that maximizes my payoff based on the distribution of agents across the two routes.

1. **Summarize Payoffs and Agent Distribution:**
   - In rounds where more drivers chose 'O-L-D', the payoff for choosing 'O-R-D' tended to be higher. This is evident in rounds 3 and 11.
   - Conversely, when more drivers chose 'O-R-D', the payoff for this route dropped significantly, as noted in rounds 4 and 17.

2. **Balance Point:**
   - A balance (almost an even split) in the number of agents (around 9 vs. 9 or 8 vs. 10) results in moderate payoffs for both routes. Examples are rounds 1, 7, and 16.

3. **Decision Making for Round 18:**
   - In round 17, choosing 'O-R-D' resulted in a low payoff with 14 agents choosing that route.
   - It's likely that more drivers will switch back to 'O-L-D' in round 18 since the payoff for 'O-R-D' in round 17 was low.
   - Historically, switching away from the overcrowded route in the following round often leads to a higher payoff.

4. **Strategic Choice:**
   - Given the trend of agent distribution and maximizing my payoff, it would be strategic to choose 'O-L-D' for round 18, anticipating that more participants will choose 'O-R-D' to avoid the overcrowded 'O-L-D' route seen in rounds like 9 and 13.

Therefore, the route choice for round 18 is 'O-L-D'.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 19:
To make a decision for round 19, let's analyze the behavior and outcomes from the previous rounds:

1. **Route Choices and Payoffs**:
   - Throughout the rounds, the choice of route alternated between O-L-D and O-R-D.
   - Higher payoffs were generally observed when the chosen route had fewer total agents.
   - Instances with balanced participants (e.g., O-L-D: 9, O-R-D: 9 in Round 1) tended to offer moderate payoffs. 
   - Choosing a route with significantly fewer agents led to higher payoffs, e.g., Round 3 with O-R-D and Round 11 with O-R-D.

2. **Identifying Patterns**:
   - O-R-D was typically chosen when anticipating fewer agents or when a recent round saw a lesser count on that route.
   - O-L-D seemed to be a preferred choice following rounds where O-R-D was heavily populated.

3. **Round Analysis for Decision**:
   - In Round 18, the O-L-D route was chosen and saw 12 agents on it, resulting in a lower payoff.
   - The pattern often shows that a shift in popularity occurs: when one route gets crowded, players tend to switch in the following round.

4. **Strategy to Maximize Payoff**:
   - Given that Round 18 had a higher agent count on O-L-D and a previous similar situation leading into a successful switch (e.g., Round 13 to 14 switch), it may be sensible to select O-R-D.

5. **Estimated Payoff Calculation**:
   - If O-R-D is chosen and it acquires fewer agents than O-L-D, it has historically guaranteed higher payoffs.
   - With the previous pattern of switching routes after high congestion, it’s plausible the agents on O-L-D will migrate to O-R-D, but the exact number remains unpredictable.

Based on these observations and patterns, the most strategic choice for round 19 that could potentially minimize travel costs and maximize payoff is to choose the route O-R-D.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 20:
To determine the best route for round 20, let's analyze the trends and outcomes from the previous rounds:

1. **Payoffs and Popularity**:
   - The choice "O-L-D" generally offers higher payoffs when fewer people choose it, keeping costs lower.
   - The choice "O-R-D" provides consistent payoffs when fewer participants choose it, with significant payoffs noted when it's almost exclusively chosen, or a rare choice among a few.

2. **Round Patterns**:
   - In rounds 3, 11, and 19, the choice "O-R-D" gave higher payoffs when fewer agents chose it.
   - In rounds 2, 13, 15, and 18, the O-L-D route was also favored in cases of smaller populations on that route, suggesting a similar pattern.
  
3. **Recent Trends**:
   - The last few rounds show an alternating pattern with "O-R-D" picking favorable outcomes alternately with "O-L-D".

4. **Probability and Decision**:
   - The balance in agent selection between both choices suggests that the crowd is alternating choices to optimize their payoffs as well.
   - The intention from agents is to switch to less congested routes based on previous outcomes.

5. **Projection for Round 20**:
   - Based on the pattern observed in the most recent outcomes, especially rounds 18 (O-L-D preferred) and 19 (O-R-D preferred), the strategy likely involves players switching once more to avoid congestion.
   - With the historical back-and-forth pattern, the expectation is for participants to now choose "O-L-D" given the previous round favored "O-R-D".

Based on the above observations, choosing "O-L-D" for round 20 is reasonable given the anticipation of lower numbers of agents choosing it.

Here's my decision formatted as a JSON:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 21:
To decide on the best route for Round 21, let's examine the results and patterns from the previous rounds.

1. **Assessing Payoffs and Conditions:**
   - Whenever the number of agents choosing route 'O-L-D' is high, the payoff tends to be lower due to increased costs from congestion. For example, in rounds where 'O-L-D' had 15 agents, the payoff was low.
   - Similarly, when 'O-R-D' was chosen by many agents, the payoff also decreased due to congestion. For example, in Round 4 where 'O-R-D' had 18 agents, the payoff was extremely low.
   - High payoffs like 180 and 130 points arose in cases where the chosen route was less congested (e.g., Round 3 with 'O-R-D' chosen by fewer agents).

2. **Balancing Outcomes:**
   - It seems that the agents tend to alternate between routes to seek balance, avoiding too much congestion on any single route. 

3. **Recent Patterns:**
   - In recent rounds, when agents are equally split or nearly equally split, the payoff is somewhat moderate (e.g., Rounds 19 and 20 with 8-10 splits).
   - In Round 19, choosing 'O-R-D' provided a decent payoff of 110 points with a moderate split (10 on 'O-L-D' and 8 on 'O-R-D').

Considering these observations:

- Choosing the less congested route typically results in a better payoff.
- Recent rounds suggest that 'O-R-D' might be congested with higher regularity when examining alternating patterns in agent choices.
  
Given that the last round had an even split, it's possible agents from both routes are weighing their recent outcomes similarly. Predicted behavior might see a slight shift from 'O-L-D' to 'O-R-D'.

**Decision for Round 21:**
- Choosing 'O-R-D' could potentially lead to a congestion similar to Round 17.
- As 'O-L-D' might experience a drop in the number of agents due to slightly poorer results recently.

Thus, selecting 'O-L-D' for Round 21 might provide a more favorable outcome considering potential agent redistribution.

Here's the decision formatted according to the schema:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 22:
To decide on the route for round 22, let's analyze the past rounds to identify any patterns or trends:

1. **Payoff Comparison**: Compare the payoffs associated with each route.
   - Higher payoffs are preferred as they indicate lower travel costs.
   
2. **Patterns of Choice**: Look for trends in how many agents typically choose each route.
   - Understand the distribution of agents to predict potential congestion on each route.

3. **Recent Rounds**:
   - There seems to be fluctuation between a majority choosing 'O-L-D' versus 'O-R-D'.
   - Recent rounds show 'O-L-D' often has fewer agents, resulting in higher payoffs. For example:
     - Round 21: Chose 'O-L-D' with 7 agents resulted in a payoff of 120.
   - Payoffs for 'O-R-D' can also be decent, but seem more volatile.

4. **Strategic Decision**: 
   - 'O-L-D' has shown relatively consistent results when the number of agents choosing it is around 7-9, often resulting in higher payoffs.
   - Recent behavior might suggest slightly fewer agents might be trying 'O-L-D' and more splitting to 'O-R-D'.

Based on this analysis, choosing 'O-L-D' might result in a higher payoff. The data doesn't suggest a strong current preference for 'O-R-D' by others if they are also assessing based on recent outcomes, potentially leading to less congestion on 'O-L-D'.

Therefore, for round 22, I will choose route 'O-L-D'.

Here is the formatted JSON decision:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 23:
To decide which route to choose in Round 23, let's analyze the pattern from previous rounds and make an informed decision:

1. **Analysis of Payoffs and Decisions**:
   - The payoff is highest when choosing a route with fewer participants, as the cost depends on the number of drivers.
   - The previous choices and payoffs show fluctuations, typically influenced by the choice distribution among all agents.
   - High payoffs on route 'O-R-D' were observed when a fewer number of participants chose it, most notably in rounds like 3, 11, and 19.

2. **Identifying Patterns**:
   - There seems to be some oscillation in preferences, but there's no clear standout preference for one route over time.
   - Recently, in round 22, many (13) chose 'O-L-D', suggesting that some drivers might still lean towards balancing their choices in subsequent rounds by switching to 'O-R-D'.

3. **Making a Prediction**:
   - Given that 13 agents went through 'O-L-D' in the last round, it might encourage some drivers to switch to 'O-R-D' to try to reduce congestion.
   - The decision to minimize travel cost by predicting others' actions is key. Given the pattern, it's likely possible a larger group might switch to 'O-R-D'.

4. **My Choice**:
   - Considering the above, if many tend to react by balancing between the routes, likely fewer drivers will choose 'O-L-D' this round. Hence, if choosing 'O-L-D', I may achieve a lower cost if others move.

Therefore, I will choose the route 'O-L-D'.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 24:
To decide which route to choose in round 24, let's analyze the data from previous rounds.

1. **Objective**: Our goal is to maximize our payoff, which means minimizing travel costs.

2. **Route Cost Functions**:
   - **O-L-D**: Cost = 10 * X + 210, where X is the number of drivers on O-L.
   - **O-R-D**: Cost = 210 + 10 * Y, where Y is the number of drivers on R-D.

3. **Historical Data Review**:
   - From the previous rounds, each route's popularity and the resulting payoffs have varied.
   - In rounds where fewer drivers chose O-L-D (such as round 23 with 5 agents), we received a high payoff of 140, indicating a very low cost.
   - Conversely, when O-L-D had a higher count (like round 22 with 13 agents), the cost was higher, resulting in a lower payoff of 60.
   - The same trend occurs for O-R-D; higher counts on O-R-D reduce payoff unless it's significantly less crowded.

4. **Current Trend Analysis**:
   - Recently, there seems to be a more even distribution in some of the rounds (e.g., Rounds 19 and 20 with 10 O-L-D and 8 O-R-D).
   - However, round 23 showed a lower number of drivers on O-L-D (5 agents), suggesting a shift or rebalancing trend potentially occurring.

5. **Strategy for Round 24**:
   - Given the historical data and a potential reduced number of drivers on O-L-D in the last round, there might be an opportunity for higher payoffs if O-L-D is less crowded.
   - Choosing O-L-D could be advantageous if the crowd from Round 23 on O-R-D (13 agents) moves again.

Therefore, considering the above analysis, the chosen route for round 24 should be:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 25:
To make a decision for round 25, let's analyze the data provided from the previous rounds. The aim is to maximize the payoff, or minimize the travel cost, by strategically choosing between the two routes: 'O-L-D' and 'O-R-D'. 

1. **Review of Previous Results**: 
   - The cost for the O-L-D route varies with the number of agents, calculated as \(10X + 210\).
   - The cost for the O-R-D route is calculated as \(210 + 10Y\).
   - Based on the results of the past rounds, your highest payoff occurred when you chose a route less populated by other agents.
   - Historical observations show that on average neither route consistently outperformed the other, but payoff generally is higher when fewer agents select a route.

2. **Recent Data Trends**: 
   - In rounds with higher O-L-D participants (e.g., round 18 with 12 agents), choosing O-R-D yielded better outcomes like in round 19 where switching to O-R-D provided a payoff of 110.
   - When choosing O-L-D with fewer agents (e.g., round 23 with 5 agents), a much higher payoff can be achieved.

3. **Balancing Strategy**:
   - There is apparent oscillation in agents distribution between rounds, indicating a potential effort by other participants to balance between the routes.
   - Recent rounds show a fluctuating preference, but agents haven’t consistently concentrated on a particular route.

4. **Decision Making**:
   - Based on the analysis above, to maximize your payoff, choosing the route with fewer expected agents is preferable.
   - Since the history shows no fixed pattern, a safe choice might be the route where other participants will concentrate less, often opposite to the last concentration (round 24: O-L-D had 11 agents).

Considering all these aspects, for round 25, I will choose route 'O-R-D'.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 26:
To determine the best route choice for round 26, we can analyze the previous rounds' outcomes to look for patterns and strategies. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify Optimal Payoff Points**: The goal is to maximize payoff, which is achieved by minimizing travel costs. High payoffs have been observed when the chosen route is less congested.
   
2. **Analyze Past Data**: 
   - Payoffs were higher when the number of people on the chosen route was lower. For example, you received a payoff of 180 in round 3 when only 1 agent chose route O-R-D.
   - When more agents chose the same route, the cost increased, leading to lower payoffs. For example, in round 4, you received a payout of only 10 as all agents chose route O-R-D.
   
3. **Payoff Consistency**: Consistently, choosing the route with fewer expected drivers tends to yield better results. 
   - For routes with 8-10 agents, the payoff usually ranges around 80-100.
   - Better payoffs like 120 or 140 were seen when there was a significant difference between the number of agents on the two routes.

4. **Trends and Changes**: 
   - Specific rounds showed a marked preference shift that might influence future outcomes. For example, observing how fewer people picked O-R-D in later rounds might suggest a decline in popularity.
   
5. **Predicted Choices** - Given the previous choices and results:
   - If one route becomes crowded, many drivers might switch to the other route in the next round for better payoffs.
   - From the frequent shifts in previous rounds, there is potential alternating behavior between the routes.

Given these analyses and strategies, the choice between the two routes seems optimal when choosing the less crowded option. However, predicting crowd behavior accurately is challenging without concrete patterns. In round 25, O-L-D was chosen by 8 agents, while O-R-D had 10 agents.

Given the alternating recent choices and payoffs, it's reasonable to predict that choosing **route O-R-D** could ensure less congestion based on past alternating behaviors and maximizing payoff from a potentially lower number of people using this route.

Thus, based on the past data and observations:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 27:
To make a decision for round 27, let's analyze the patterns and outcomes from the previous rounds.

1. **Assess the Payoffs:**
   - High payoffs (e.g., 140, 130, 120) in rounds 13, 2, 21, and 23 occur when the route chosen has fewer total participants. For these rounds, the opposing route had significantly more drivers, which influences the cost due to the variable component.
   - Very low payoffs (e.g., 10) occurred when nearly all participants chose the same route (e.g., round 4, where all chose O-R-D).

2. **Examine Specific Patterns:**
   - When Route O-L-D was chosen with fewer people (e.g., round 23), payoffs were higher. Conversely, high participation in O-L-D resulted in low payoffs (e.g., rounds 5, 9).
   - Similarly, when Route O-R-D had fewer people (e.g., rounds 3, 19), payoffs were higher.

3. **Current Strategy:**
   - There is a somewhat alternating pattern where the number of participants on each route tends to flip in subsequent rounds, likely as participants react to past outcomes.

4. **Recent Rounds Dynamics:**
   - In recent rounds (e.g., 24 to 26), the number of agents on each route tends to be relatively balanced or slightly favor one route. Given that O-R-D had more participants in the last round, it might be likely that agents will switch to O-L-D.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - Given the patterns and anticipated behavior, it is likely advantageous to choose the route that had fewer participants last round because participants who were on the more crowded route may switch in an attempt to optimize their payoff.

Based on this thought process, for round 27, I will choose the route that previously had fewer participants as it's likely to be less congested due to behavioral shifts by other participants.

```json
{
  "route": "O-L-D"
}
```

Round 28:
To determine which route to choose in round 28, let's analyze the past behavior to identify any patterns or trends:

### Summary of Past Rounds:
1. Each round involves a choice between two routes: O-L-D and O-R-D.
2. Your goal is to maximize payoff, meaning minimizing travel costs.
3. The decision impacts costs due to the variable segment costs based on the number of drivers on each segment.

### Observations:
- **Balanced outcomes**: In rounds like 1, 15, and 27 where there were 9 drivers on each route, payoffs were lower (e.g., 100 points).
- **Minimal Competition**: The highest payoffs were observed when the choice was opposite most participants. For instance, in round 3 with only 1 driver on O-R-D, the payoff was 180.
- **Overloaded Paths**: Routes with an excessive number of drivers (e.g., 18 drivers on O-R-D in round 4) result in very low payoffs (10 points or 60 points).
- **Medium loads**: A moderate number of drivers on the chosen route generally resulted in better payoffs over fully loaded routes.

### Strategy for Round 28:
Based on these observations, achieving the highest payoff tends to occur when choosing the route with fewer drivers, balancing between risk and observed distribution from past rounds.

Based on previous rounds and the patterns observed:
- Opting for a less populated route has provided higher payoffs.
- Recently, the "O-L-D" route has often been less crowded based on rounds 22 and 23.

### Decision:
Given the historical fluctuations and the lower average occupancy on the O-L-D in recent rounds, choosing route "O-L-D" might maximize the outcome.

### JSON Response:
```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 29:
To make a decision in round 29, let's analyze the previous rounds, focusing on the payoffs and the distribution of agents on routes:

1. **Route O-L-D Details**:
   - Typically, when fewer agents choose O-L-D, the payoff tends to be higher.
   - Notably, for round 3 when only 1 agent chose route O-R-D, the payoff for that route was high (180).
   - Similarly, in round 23, when only 5 agents chose O-L-D, the payoff was high (140).
   - When the agents are equally split between the routes or fewer agents are on O-L-D, the payoff tends to be substantial (rounds 1, 15, 21, 27, and 28).

2. **Route O-R-D Details**:
   - In general, O-R-D has lower payoffs when more agents are on it.
   - However, in some cases, it still may yield higher payoffs. For example, in round 3, when almost all agents were on O-R-D, O-L-D had an extremely high payoff.
   - High payoffs are more sporadic for O-R-D based on agent distribution. 

3. **Trend Analysis**:
   - There seems to be a back-and-forth pattern where some rounds have more agents going on either O-L-D or O-R-D.
   - The payoff can swing based on this back-and-forth, as agents may be adjusting based on previous outcomes.
   - Sometimes, participants may attempt to even out their choices, expecting others to switch routes accordingly.

4. **Decision for Round 29**:
   - Given that the last couple of rounds have had equal or slightly more agents opting for O-L-D (rounds 27 and 28), it might suggest a tendency for agents to start moving towards O-R-D again. 
   - It can be beneficial to choose the route with potentially fewer agents for a higher payoff.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, in this round, choosing route "O-R-D" might yield a better payoff because we anticipate more agents starting to flock back to O-L-D after consecutive rounds with fewer agents on O-R-D.

Here is the JSON formatted decision:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 30:
To make an informed decision for round 30, we need to analyze the data from the previous rounds and try to identify patterns or strategies that will help maximize our payoff. Let's consider the key observations:

1. **Payoffs and Distribution:**
   - The highest payoff observed was 180 in round 3 when I chose route O-R-D with only 1 agent (myself) using it.
   - Payoffs are generally higher when fewer agents choose the same route.
   - Payoffs tend to drop significantly when many agents choose the same route.

2. **Route Selection Patterns:**
   - There hasn't been a consistent pattern in terms of which route to choose. However, rounds where the number of agents was more balanced (e.g., both routes having 8-10 agents) generally resulted in similar payoffs for both routes.

3. **Recent Choices and Results:**
   - In the most recent rounds (26-29), both routes have been relatively balanced in terms of agent distribution, and both yielded moderate payoffs. For instance, choosing route O-R-D in round 29 when 12 agents went that way resulted in a payoff of 70.
   - In rounds where I chose the less popular route, the payoff tended to be higher. For example, in rounds 23 and 13, choosing the less populated route O-L-D resulted in better payoffs.

4. **Strategic Choice:**
   - Given that round 29 had route O-R-D being more popular (12 agents), it might be strategic to choose route O-L-D in round 30, anticipating that others might react to the higher number on O-R-D.

Based on these observations, choosing the less populated route historically has the potential to yield higher payoffs. Therefore, for round 30, I will choose the route that I anticipate fewer agents might select, which based on recent trends could potentially be route O-L-D.

Here is the decision in the required JSON format:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 31:
To decide on the route for round 31, let's analyze the previous rounds:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Route `O-L-D` seems to perform well when fewer drivers choose it (5-9 agents). 
   - Route `O-R-D` seems to be less favorable when it has more drivers but does well with fewer drivers.

2. **Behavioral Patterns:**
   - Given the alternating pattern, drivers might switch between the routes to try to minimize their own costs.
   - The tendency seems to sway towards `O-L-D` when there's overcrowding on `O-R-D`, and vice versa.

3. **Recent Trends (R25-R30):**
   - Round 25: I chose `O-R-D`, 10 drivers were on `O-R-D`. Payoff was 90.
   - Round 26: Similar choice with 12 on `O-R-D`, lower payoff (70).
   - Round 27: `O-L-D` with balanced choice (9 each), decent payoff (100).
   - Round 28: `O-L-D` showing a slight overcrowd (10), modest payoff (90).
   - Round 29: `O-R-D` with overcrowding (12), lower payoff (70).
   - Round 30 saw a slightly higher number on `O-L-D` (11) than on `O-R-D` (7). Resulted in a payoff of 80.

4. **Assessing Next Move:**
   - Recent rounds suggest drivers might lean towards `O-L-D`.
   - Considering the data, it seems best to choose `O-R-D` when `O-L-D` has more agents aiming for minimizing costs potentially since fewer agents might choose it this round.

5. **Strategic Decision for Round 31:**
   - To achieve a higher payoff, it makes more sense to switch to the route that seems to gain fewer drivers based on alternating patterns noted, which, given the recent trend, could likely be `O-R-D`.

Hence, it's reasonable to choose the `O-R-D` route for round 31 with the expectation that fewer participants may choose it, providing a better payoff opportunity.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 32:
To decide which route to take in round 32, let's analyze the results from the previous rounds:

1. **Routes and Costs**:
   - The route O-L-D has variable costs that depend on the number of drivers X, where the cost is 10X + 210.
   - The route O-R-D has fixed costs of 210 and also depends on the number of drivers Y for the segment R-D, where the cost is 210 + 10Y.

2. **Previous Trends**:
   - Past observations indicate that when a route is more crowded, it results in a higher cost, and consequently, a lower payoff.
   - There is a cyclical nature, where agents switch from one route to another based on previous high costs.

3. **Analyzing Recent Rounds**:
   - In rounds where many agents chose O-L-D, the payoffs for choosing O-R-D were higher and vice versa.
   - In round 31, the majority (13) chose O-L-D, and the payoff for choosing O-R-D was higher (140).
   - Looking at this dynamic, when one route starts getting crowded, it's often best to consider switching to the other route, assuming this pattern continues.

4. **Decision Making**:
   - Based on the past pattern where crowds tend to shift back and forth every few rounds, and considering the last round where O-L-D was more crowded, it might be beneficial to choose O-R-D in round 32, anticipating that other participants may switch from O-L-D to O-R-D.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - To capitalize on this potential switch, choosing route O-R-D may yield a lower cost and thereby a higher payoff.

Using this analysis, the decision for round 32 is to choose the route O-R-D.

Here's the formatted JSON decision:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 33:
To make an informed decision for round 33, let's analyze the pattern from previous rounds and calculate potential payoffs for both routes. The goal is to choose the route that potentially maximizes the payoff based on observed trends.

### Historical Analysis

1. **Route O-L-D Performance:**
   - When choosing O-L-D, payoffs ranged from 40 to 140.
   - High payoff of 140 was observed when there were fewer agents (5) on O-L-D (Round 23).
   - Lower payoffs were typically seen with 12 to 15 agents on O-L-D.

2. **Route O-R-D Performance:**
   - When choosing O-R-D, payoffs ranged from 10 to 180.
   - Highest payoff of 180 occurred when only 1 agent was on O-R-D (Round 3).
   - Payoff was quite low (20) when 17 agents were on O-R-D (Round 32).

### Recent Trends

- The route choice alternates quite often between the two options, with popularity seemingly cyclic.
- In recent rounds (31-32), O-R-D saw lower payoffs due to increased agents on that route.
- Historically, both routes tend to balance out in terms of agents over a few rounds, with agents switching routes in response to changing costs.

### Decision Criteria for Round 33

- **Route O-L-D**: Often yields better payoffs when fewer people choose it. However, the payoff significantly drops when around 13-15 agents select it.
- **Route O-R-D**: Has potential for high payoff when the number of agents is minimal. It suffered recently possibly due to a high concentration of agents.

### Strategy

- Based on the observed payoff patterns, O-L-D seems to have a more consistent performance when agent numbers are around 7-10.
- Recent rounds show a spike in agents on O-R-D, leading to reduced payoffs. Switching to O-L-D could capitalize on this pattern if other agents also observed this.

### Conclusion

Choosing **O-L-D** for round 33 is a strategic decision, as it historically provides a better payoff when the number of agents is moderately controlled.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 34:
To decide which route to choose for round 34, let's analyze the previous results:

1. **Cost Calculation:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** Costs 10X + 210, where X is the number of agents choosing O-L-D.
   - **Route O-R-D:** Costs 210 + 10Y, where Y is the number of agents choosing O-R-D.

2. **Endowment and Payoff:**
   - Endowment = 400.
   - Payoff = Endowment - Cost.

3. **Observations from Previous Rounds:**
   - **Balanced or near-balanced choices** (O-L-D = 9, O-R-D = 9 or O-L-D = 10, O-R-D = 8) tend to give average payoffs around 90 or 100.
   - **Choosing the lesser-chosen route** often resulted in better payoffs. When the number of agents on the chosen route is significantly less, the cost decreases and the payoff increases. Examples include:
     - Round 3: Chose O-R-D with only 1 agent, resulting in the highest payoff of 180.
     - Round 19: Chose O-R-D with 8 agents and received a good payoff of 110.
   - **Choosing the more populous route** tends to yield lower payoffs. For instance:
     - Round 4: Chose O-R-D with 18 agents, resulting in a low payoff of 10.
     - Round 32: Chose O-R-D with 17 agents, resulting in a low payoff of 20.

4. **Strategy for Round 34:**
   - Aim to choose the less popular route based on recent trends.
   - If recent rounds had a lower number of agents on one route, consider choosing that route to minimize cost and maximize payoff.

From the last few rounds, there has been fluctuation in route discrepancies. Round 33 had more agents on O-L-D. Thus, choosing O-R-D might offer a higher chance of achieving a better payoff.

Therefore, for round 34, I will choose route:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 35:
To make an informed decision for round 35, let's evaluate the previous rounds, identify patterns, and strategize based on the results:

1. **Cost Function Understanding**:
   - Route O-L-D: The cost is \(10 \times \text{(number of agents on O-L)} + 210\).
   - Route O-R-D: The cost is \(210 + 10 \times \text{(number of agents on R-D)}\).
   
2. **Historical Analysis**:
   - When choosing O-L-D, a payoff of 140 (best O-L-D payoff) was achieved when there were fewer agents on O-L-D (5 agents).
   - When choosing O-R-D, a payoff of 180 (best O-R-D payoff) was achieved when there were significantly fewer agents on that route (1 agent).
   - Recent rounds with optimal payoff switches between routes:
     - Payoffs decreased when too many participants selected the same route.
     - Round 23 and Round 31 show high payoffs by choosing a route opposite to a more crowded one.

3. **Fluctuation Pattern**:
   - Players seem to switch to less crowded routes to minimize costs and maximize payoffs.
   - Frequent alternation between favoring O-L-D and O-R-D depending on participant distribution.

4. **Recent Trends**:
   - In recent rounds (30-34), fewer agents tend to select O-L-D when too many choose O-R-D and vice versa.
   - Punished in rounds with extreme crowding when O-R-D is chosen in rounds 32 and 34, suggesting others may move back to O-L-D.

5. **Strategy for Round 35**:
   - Given the previous round where 14 agents chose O-R-D, resulting in a low payoff, it’s likely some players may migrate back to O-L-D.
   - To potentially maximize payout, choose the less crowded route, expecting others to switch to O-L-D for balance.

Based on the analysis, I will select route "O-R-D" for round 35:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 36:
To decide which route to choose for round 36, let's analyze the past round data and derive a strategy:

1. **Cost Structure and Payoff Calculation**:
   - For route `O-L-D`, the travel cost is `10X + 210`.
   - For route `O-R-D`, the travel cost is `210 + 10Y`.
   - Your payoff in points is calculated as `400 - travel_cost`.

2. **Observations from Past Rounds**:
   - Typically, larger differences in the number of drivers between routes create opportunities for higher payoffs.
   - If more drivers pick a certain route, the cost for that route increases.
   - Swapping routes based on trends seems to have varied in success - neutral choices such as rounds with an even split (9-9 or 10-8) generally result in moderate payoffs.

3. **Trend Analysis**:
   - In numerous rounds (1, 8, 11, 15, 19, 21, 25) a roughly balanced distribution or a moderate skew (8-10 or 10-8) has favored route `O-R-D` as it results in high payoff.
   - Extreme imbalances like 17-1 or 1-17 significantly increase costs on one route, leading to more risk-laden payoffs.

4. **Strategy for Round 36**:
   - Considering previous rounds where payoff was maximized, it's strategically beneficial to select routes with a predicted moderate balance or moderate skew.
   - More recent rounds (e.g., 29 and 35) suggested a preference or drift towards route `O-R-D` with higher contributors to the cost from `O-L-D`.

5. **Choice**:
   - Given the data and analysis, choosing route `O-R-D` has often resulted in a higher payoff when the number of participants is below a certain threshold and when `O-L-D` attracts more participants or is evenly split.
   - Also observing the past rounds suggests a possible clustering behavior which leads to 'trends' correctable with course-corrective decisions such as switching based on observable grouping.

Therefore, the choice for round 36 is to select route `O-R-D`.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 37:
To decide which route to choose in round 37, let's analyze the previous data and trends.

1. **Understanding Cost Functions**: 
   - Route `O-L-D`: Cost is `10X + 210` where `X` is the number of drivers on `O-L`.
   - Route `O-R-D`: Cost is `210 + 10Y` where `Y` is the number of drivers on `R-D`.

2. **Analyzing Previous Rounds**:
   - Each round, the balance of drivers between routes `O-L-D` and `O-R-D` fluctuates.
   - Lower costs seem to correspond to fewer drivers on a given segment where costs increase with the number of drivers.
   - Both highly skewed distributions (e.g., all on one route) and even distributions (e.g., 9 on both routes) have occurred.

3. **Recent Trends**:
   - In the last few rounds, the distribution was nearly balanced in rounds 28 and 36 with 9-9 and slight unbalances in other rounds (8-10, 12-6, etc.).
   - Round 36 was completely balanced at 9 drivers on each route, resulting in a payoff of 100 for `O-R-D`.

4. **Driver Behavior**:
   - Participants switch routes if they incur high travel costs, seeking routes with fewer drivers to minimize costs.

5. **Strategy for Round 37**:
   - When previously balanced or slightly unbalanced, middle-range costs were incurred.
   - Therefore, aligning with recent balanced splits seems favorable, especially since switching costs can lead to either improvements or unexpected increases depending on others' concurrent decisions.

Based on the analysis, if we consider the trend towards balance and aim to minimize cost while maximizing payoff, choosing the route that recently yielded the highest average payoff or was balanced is optimal.

Therefore, for round 37, to align with expected shared participant tendencies to balance and minimize drastic switches, choosing **route `O-R-D`** is the strategy.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 38:
To decide the best route for Round 38, let's consider the history and analyze the patterns in my previous choices and their outcomes.

1. **Route Costs:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** Total cost = 10X + 210
   - **Route O-R-D:** Total cost = 210 + 10Y

2. **Key Observations from Past Rounds:**
   - The rounds where I received a high payoff (close to 180-140 points, e.g., Rounds 3, 11, 13, 19, 23, 31, and 37) were characterized by fewer participants on the route I chose.
   - Rounds with more participants on my chosen route resulted in lower payoffs (e.g., Round 4 where I received 10 points as all 18 used O-R-D).

3. **Balanced Rounds:**
   - Payoffs around 100 were seen when the agents were nearly balanced (for instance, Rounds 1, 15, 27, 36).

4. **Decision Strategy:**
   - Aim for a route that minimizes congestion. Historically, when participants are unbalanced between the routes, one benefiting greatly. 
   - Given the unpredictability, alternating strategies seem to fit.

5. **Recent Trends:**
   - In recent rounds (36 and 37), we saw an equal split followed by a shift of focus back to O-L-D in Round 38, reducing numbers on O-R-D.
   - Given Round 37's outcome, history suggests an increase in participants choosing O-L-D next.

6. **Chosen Strategy:**
   - Based on the information, my strategy is to choose **O-R-D** anticipating that fewer might select it due to previous trends shifting to O-L-D after dominant choice rounds.

By selecting the route that historically provided decent payoffs with reduced congestion, I optimize my chances for a higher payoff.

Round 39:
To make a decision for round 39, let's analyze the previous rounds to identify any patterns that might help in choosing the route that would maximize the payoff.

1. **Analysis of Patterns:**
   - The game involves a balance between the number of agents choosing each route, resulting in fluctuating costs.
   - In previous rounds, a higher number of agents on a route decreased the payoff because of higher segment costs.

2. **Payoff Examination:**
   - Higher payoffs were received when fewer agents chose the same route as I did.
   - Significant variability has occurred based on the number of people choosing each route, suggesting some unpredictability and potential strategic decision-making by the others.

3. **Recent Observations:**
   - In rounds where 'O-R-D' was chosen last (e.g., round 38), there was a moderate number of agents (11) leading to a reasonable payoff (80).
   - Before that, rounds 37 and 36 showed better payoffs when choosing 'O-R-D' because fewer others chose it.

4. **Strategic Decision:**
   - The optimal strategy involves choosing the route with fewer expected participants, which in contrast leads to lower cost.
   - From recent rounds, notably the pattern of oscillation between routes (for instance, after a high turnout round like 36, the next round had a more even split), suggests that 'O-L-D' might see fewer participants after being crowded and unpopular in even rounds like 38.

5. **Decision:**
   - Based on the historical oscillation of full capacities, potential shift, and agent preferences, choosing 'O-L-D' in round 39 might incur fewer participants, suggesting a higher payoff probability.

Now, we translate our decision into the required JSON format:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 40:
To make an informed decision for round 40, let's analyze the data from previous rounds:

1. **Comparison of Payoffs**: 

   - When choosing **O-L-D**: 
     - Payoffs have varied, with figures such as 130 (best payoff), 120, 110, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, and 40 (worst payoff).
     - The number of drivers on O-L-D varied significantly, affecting costs.

   - When choosing **O-R-D**: 
     - Payoffs include 180 (best payoff), 140, 130, 110, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, and 20 (worst payoff).
     - Performance is inconsistent due to varying numbers of drivers on O-R-D.

2. **Trend Analysis**:

   - **O-L-D** tends to yield better outcomes when fewer drivers choose it (5 to 9 drivers is beneficial).
   - **O-R-D** tends to yield a better payoff when few drivers choose the route (as few as 1-6 drivers).

3. **Understanding Group Behavior**:

   - Certain rounds showed an overpopulation of drivers on one route leading to very low payoffs. For example, when 17 drivers chose O-R-D, payoffs were extremely low (10 and 20).
   - Predicting the choices of 17 other drivers is crucial. A balanced choice can minimize cost uncertainty.

4. **Recent Rounds**:

   - In rounds 38 and 39, a balanced number of drivers (close to an even split) on both routes were seen. This pattern could persist if the group aims for balance.

5. **Optimal Choice**:

   - Consider choosing a route where you anticipate fewer drivers (5-9) based on historical balance.
   - Given the recent pattern of evenly distributed choices, it's safer to choose the route that recently attracted fewer drivers (O-R-D), if aiming for less congestion.

With these considerations in mind, my suggestion for round 40 is to choose route **O-R-D** given the potential for fewer drivers and thereby potentially higher payoff.

  "route": "O-R-D"
