System Message:

You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 x X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 x X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

LLM Outputs:
Round 1:
To make the optimal decision for choosing a route from the available options, we need to analyze the potential costs associated with each route based on the number of drivers choosing similar routes.

### Step 1: Understand the Cost Structure
- **Route O-L-D**: The cost is determined by the formula \(10X + 210\), where \(X\) is the number of participants choosing the O-L segment.
- **Route O-L-R-D**: The cost is computed as \(10X + 0 + 10Y\), where \(X\) is the number of participants choosing the O-L segment and \(Y\) is the number choosing R-D.
- **Route O-R-D**: The fixed cost is \(210 + 10Y\), where \(Y\) is the number of people choosing the R-D segment.

### Step 2: Consider Potential Distribution of Drivers
We need to assume how other drivers might choose their routes. Since we have no data from previous rounds yet, we can assume that participants might spread somewhat evenly across routes.

### Step 3: Calculate Expected Costs
Let's assume that in the absence of previous data, there's an even distribution of drivers:
- If all routes are chosen equally, there would be 6 drivers per route (18 drivers / 3 routes).

#### Estimating Costs:
- **Route O-L-D**: Expected cost = \(10 \times 6 + 210 = 270\)
- **Route O-L-R-D**: Expected cost = \(10 \times 6 + 0 + 10 \times 12 = 180\)
  - (Here we assume that drivers from O-R-D also use R-D, hence 12 total on R-D)
- **Route O-R-D**: Expected cost = \(210 + 10 \times 12 = 330\)

### Step 4: Choose the Minimum Cost Route for Maximum Payoff
To maximize payoff, we need to select the route with the minimum expected cost.

From the calculations above:
- **Route O-L-R-D** has the lowest expected cost of 180.

### Decision
Based on the analysis, selecting the route "O-L-R-D" provides the expected lowest cost and hence maximizes the payoff for this round.

### JSON Output
```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 2:
To determine which route to choose in round 2, let's review the results from round 1 and evaluate the travel costs associated with each route based on the number of agents.

### **Round 1 Review:**
- **Your Chosen Route:** O-L-R-D
  - **Payoff:** 110 points
- **Number of Agents on Each Route:**
  - O-L-D: 2 agents
  - O-L-R-D: 11 agents
  - O-R-D: 5 agents

### **Travel Costs Calculation:**

1. **O-L-D:**
   - Cost = 10 * X (for O-L) + 210 (for L-D)
   - In round 1: X = O-L = 2 + 11 = 13 drivers (yourself not included)
   - Total Cost = 10 * 13 + 210 = 340
   - Payoff = 400 - 340 = 60

2. **O-L-R-D:**
   - Cost = 10 * X (for O-L) + 0 (for L-R) + 10 * Y (for R-D)
   - In round 1: 
     - X = O-L = 2 + 11 = 13 drivers
     - Y = R-D = 5 + 11 = 16 drivers
   - Total Cost = 10 * 13 + 0 + 10 * 16 = 290
   - Payoff = 400 - 290 = 110 (this matches your payoff)

3. **O-R-D:**
   - Cost = 210 (for O-R) + 10 * Y (for R-D)
   - In round 1: Y = R-D = 5 + 11 = 16 drivers
   - Total Cost = 210 + 10 * 16 = 370
   - Payoff = 400 - 370 = 30

### **Analysis:**
- **O-L-D:** A lower payoff due to a higher cost of congestion on the shared O-L and costly L-D segments.
- **O-L-R-D:** Provides a middle ground with mixed players on both O-L and R-D segments.
- **O-R-D:** Witnessed a high congestion on R-D, highest cost, and thus the least favorable payoff.

### **Decision:**
The route O-L-R-D seems to offer a reasonable balance between congestion and costs, as concluded from the previous round's analysis. It avoids the fixed high cost on L-D and effectively balances costs with the number of agents going on R-D.

### **JSON Output:**
```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 3:
To make an informed decision for round 3, let's analyze the outcomes of the previous rounds and consider a strategy to maximize the payoff.

1. **Understand the Cost Structure:**
   - **Route O-L-D**: Cost = 10X + 210
   - **Route O-L-R-D**: Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y
   - **Route O-R-D**: Cost = 210 + 10Y

2. **Analysis of Previous Rounds:**
   - **Round 1**: 
     - You chose route O-L-R-D with 11 agents on it, resulting in a payoff of 110.
     - O-L-D had 2 agents, and O-R-D had 5 agents.
     - Cost calculation for O-L-R-D: 10(11) + 0 + 10(5) = 160, Payoff = 400 - 160 = 240 (Typo in input, expected payoff is not matching with 240, but let's rely on other important figures).
   
   - **Round 2**:
     - You chose route O-L-R-D again but only 7 agents were on it this time, resulting in a payoff of 150.
     - O-L-D had 11 agents, and O-R-D had 0 agents.
     - Cost calculation for O-L-R-D: 10(7) + 0 + 10(0) = 70, Payoff = 400 - 70 = 330 (Again, verifying with potential typo).

3. **Observations:**
   - Moving from round 1 to round 2, the traffic on O-L-R-D reduced, which increased your payoff.
   - The O-R-D route was unused in round 2, suggesting the opportunity to explore this option.

4. **Strategy for Round 3:**
   - Given that O-R-D was not used in round 2, opting for this route may offer a lower cost if other players continue avoiding it.
   - By choosing O-R-D, there is a potential cost of 210 (fixed) if still nobody else chooses it, leading to higher payoffs.

5. **Decision for Round 3:**
   - Choose route **O-R-D** to explore the potential for lower traffic and thus a lower travel cost, maximizing the payoff.

Based on this analysis, the choice is to select route O-R-D.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 4:
To determine the optimal route choice for round 4, let's analyze the previous rounds and the cost structure of the routes:

1. **Round 1 Analysis:**
   - Chose route: O-L-R-D
   - Payoff: 110
   - Agent distribution: O-L-D (2 agents), O-L-R-D (11 agents), O-R-D (5 agents)
   - Since many agents chose O-L-R-D, it resulted in a higher cost due to congestion on the segments O-L and R-D.

2. **Round 2 Analysis:**
   - Chose route: O-L-R-D
   - Payoff: 150
   - Agent distribution: O-L-D (11 agents), O-L-R-D (7 agents), O-R-D (0 agents)
   - A lower number of agents on O-L-R-D led to a better payoff compared to Round 1, but the segment O-L was still congested due to many agents choosing O-L-D.

3. **Round 3 Analysis:**
   - Chose route: O-R-D
   - Payoff: 10
   - Agent distribution: O-L-D (0 agents), O-L-R-D (1 agent), O-R-D (17 agents)
   - A heavy congestion on R-D increased the cost significantly, leading to a minimal payoff.

**Strategy for Round 4:**

Given the data:
- O-L-D consistently had either 0 or a lower number of agents in previous rounds, which suggests potential for lower congestion and cost.
- O-L-R-D can have varying congestion, making it unpredictable.
- O-R-D was highly congested in round 3, resulting in high costs.

Considering the costs and potential agent distribution:
- O-L-D might be a safer choice as it seems to have had less congestion previously, suggesting the likelihood of a better payoff.

Based on this analysis, the optimal route choice for round 4 would be "O-L-D". The aim is to minimize cost by selecting a potentially less congested route.

Here's the JSON formatted answer:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 5:
To make a decision about which route to choose in round 5, I'll analyze the previous rounds' results:

1. **Round 1:**
   - I chose route O-L-R-D.
   - Payoff: 110
   - Agent distribution: 
     - O-L-D: 2
     - O-L-R-D: 11
     - O-R-D: 5
   - **Analysis:** The route O-L-R-D was heavily congested, leading to a higher cost and lower payoff.

2. **Round 2:**
   - I chose route O-L-R-D again.
   - Payoff: 150
   - Agent distribution:
     - O-L-D: 11
     - O-L-R-D: 7
     - O-R-D: 0
   - **Analysis:** The O-L-R-D route had fewer agents than in round 1, leading to a better payoff.

3. **Round 3:**
   - I chose the route O-R-D.
   - Payoff: 10
   - Agent distribution:
     - O-L-D: 0
     - O-L-R-D: 1
     - O-R-D: 17
   - **Analysis:** The route O-R-D was extremely congested, resulting in high costs and the lowest payoff.

4. **Round 4:**
   - I chose route O-L-D.
   - Payoff: 10
   - Agent distribution:
     - O-L-D: 3
     - O-L-R-D: 15
     - O-R-D: 0
   - **Analysis:** O-L-D was less congested, but choosing it did not provide a better payoff due to other factors.

**Strategy Decision for Round 5:**

- O-L-R-D appears to have variable congestion based on agent distribution in previous rounds.
- O-R-D, while promising fixed costs initially, can lead to drastically low payoffs if the majority of agents choose it.
- O-L-D gives a consistent cost addition to agents who choose it, but payoff can be affected by congestion in O-L.

Given the variability and unpredictability of agent choices, and considering the payoffs over the last 4 rounds, I'll choose the route that balances congestion risk and fixed cost monotony. From the analysis, returning to **O-L-R-D** may result in a relatively higher payoff if fewer agents congest the shared segments.

Therefore, I choose route O-L-R-D for this round.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 6:
To choose the optimal route for round 6, let's analyze the available data from previous rounds to identify trends and assess potential costs for each route.

### Previous Round Analysis:

1. **Routes and Payoffs:**
   - **O-L-D:**
     - Round 4: 3 agents on this route with a payoff of 10.
   - **O-L-R-D:**
     - Round 1: Very crowded, 11 agents, high cost, payoff of 110.
     - Round 2: Less crowded, 7 agents, better payoff of 150.
     - Round 5: 7 agents again, resulting in a relatively good payoff of 150.
   - **O-R-D:**
     - Round 3: Very crowded, 17 agents, quite costly, resulting in a poor payoff of 10.
     - Round 5: 4 agents, suggesting fluctuations based on patterns rather than guarantees.

2. **Patterns:**
   - **O-L-D** route performs poorly when crowded (low previous participant numbers suggest unpredictability).
   - **O-L-R-D** route seems to have a stable participant number, occasionally leading to favorable payoffs.
   - **O-R-D** route is volatile in popularity, could be costly when congested.

### Strategy for Round 6:

Given the observed trends, selecting a route with moderate traffic might help balance overall costs and benefits.
- **O-L-R-D**: This route has demonstrated consistently moderate traffic and reasonable payoffs over multiple rounds. It presents a balance between fixed costs and controlled dynamic costs, making it a strategic choice.

Therefore, choosing the O-L-R-D route could potentially yield the most favorable cost versus payoff balance for this round.

Here's the JSON response according to the decision:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 7:
To make an informed decision for round 7, let's analyze the data from the previous rounds with a focus on the payoff and the distribution of agents across routes:

### Previous Rounds Analysis:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Choice: O-L-R-D
   - Payoff: 110
   - Agents: O-L-D: 2, O-L-R-D: 11, O-R-D: 5

2. **Round 2:**
   - Choice: O-L-R-D
   - Payoff: 150
   - Agents: O-L-D: 11, O-L-R-D: 7, O-R-D: 0

3. **Round 3:**
   - Choice: O-R-D
   - Payoff: 10
   - Agents: O-L-D: 0, O-L-R-D: 1, O-R-D: 17

4. **Round 4:**
   - Choice: O-L-D
   - Payoff: 10
   - Agents: O-L-D: 3, O-L-R-D: 15, O-R-D: 0

5. **Round 5:**
   - Choice: O-L-R-D
   - Payoff: 150
   - Agents: O-L-D: 7, O-L-R-D: 7, O-R-D: 4

6. **Round 6:**
   - Choice: O-L-R-D
   - Payoff: 120
   - Agents: O-L-D: 3, O-L-R-D: 10, O-R-D: 5

### Observations:

- Routes with a lower number of agents tend to yield a higher payoff.
- In rounds where O-R-D had fewer agents (or none), this route was the costliest (as observed in round 3).
- Round 2 and Round 5 show that O-L-R-D provided a relatively high payoff (150) when it was not overcrowded.
- Choices like O-L-D and O-R-D should be avoided if they attract many agents, leading to higher costs.

### Decision-making Strategy:

- **O-L-R-D**: This has provided decent payoffs when not overcrowded. However, it fluctuates based on the number of agents, as seen in Rounds 1, 2, 5, and 6.
- **O-L-D**: Offered a low payoff of 10 in Round 4 even with only 3 agents, indicating that when O-L-R-D is crowded, O-L-D starts attracting more agents.
- **O-R-D**: Highest cost route in Round 3 with many agents. It provided a clear indication of a bad choice when crowded.

### Conclusion:

Given the data from previous rounds, a calculated risk on O-L-R-D could still yield a reasonable payoff if it attracts an optimal number of agents (less than 10). The fluctuations in previous rounds show it as a strategic choice but needs careful consideration of current trends. Checking agent behavior patterns from rounds 1, 5, and 6 can lead to picking a crowded or less crowded O-L-R-D.

Let's choose **O-L-R-D** while keeping in mind the potential fluctuation in payoffs with agent distribution.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 8:
To make an informed decision in round 8, let's analyze the strategies and payoffs from the previous rounds.

### Analysis of Previous Rounds:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Choice: O-L-R-D
   - Received Payoff: 110
   - Distribution: O-L-D (2), O-L-R-D (11), O-R-D (5)

2. **Round 2:**
   - Choice: O-L-R-D
   - Received Payoff: 150
   - Distribution: O-L-D (11), O-L-R-D (7), O-R-D (0)

3. **Round 3:**
   - Choice: O-R-D
   - Received Payoff: 10
   - Distribution: O-L-D (0), O-L-R-D (1), O-R-D (17)

4. **Round 4:**
   - Choice: O-L-D
   - Received Payoff: 10
   - Distribution: O-L-D (3), O-L-R-D (15), O-R-D (0)

5. **Round 5:**
   - Choice: O-L-R-D
   - Received Payoff: 150
   - Distribution: O-L-D (7), O-L-R-D (7), O-R-D (4)

6. **Round 6:**
   - Choice: O-L-R-D
   - Received Payoff: 120
   - Distribution: O-L-D (3), O-L-R-D (10), O-R-D (5)

7. **Round 7:**
   - Choice: O-L-R-D
   - Received Payoff: 90
   - Distribution: O-L-D (3), O-L-R-D (13), O-R-D (2)

### Patterns and Observations:
- **Route O-R-D:** In Round 3 it was overcrowded with 17 agents, leading to a low payoff. It’s risky if it becomes too popular.
- **Route O-L-D:** Was effective in Round 4 with only 3 agents, but was risky when more participants chose it as seen in Rounds 1 and 5.
- **Route O-L-R-D:** Offered decent payoffs in Rounds 2, 5, and 6, with fluctuating participation. This route tends to offer a balanced option between fixed and variable costs.

### Decision Strategy for Round 8:
- **Minimize Risk:** Aiming for a route with moderate payoff and consistent performance across previous rounds.
- **Traffic Dynamics:** Based on the observed distributions, Route O-L-R-D tends to have a balanced distribution, not overcrowding like O-R-D in Round 3 or being less rewarding like O-L-D in Round 4.
- **Past Performance:** O-L-R-D seems to generally be less risky unless participation becomes excessive as in Round 7.

Thus, based on these variables and the goal to minimize high costs seen in O-R-D or O-L-D under certain conditions, choosing route O-L-R-D again for Round 8 aims to capitalize on its generally balanced performance.

### Selected Route:
```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 9:
To decide on the optimal route for round 9, let's analyze the information provided in the summary of the previous rounds:

1. **Observation of Route Choices**:
   - In the previous rounds, the O-L-R-D route had varying numbers of participants, ranging from 7 to 15. The lower the number of participants, the higher your payoff.
   - The O-R-D route once had all 17 other drivers and resulted in a minimal payoff for you (10 points).
   - The O-L-D route, if chosen by few participants, would likely yield a higher payoff, though costs will increase proportionally with more participants.

2. **Assessment of Payoff Trends**:
   - Rounds with a balanced but low number of participants on the O-L-R-D route (rounds 2 and 5) led to relatively higher payoffs of 150 points.
   - The fewer the total number of participants choosing a route that you also choose, the lower the cost and higher the remaining payoff from the 400-point endowment.

3. **Prediction for Round 9**:
   - Based on past patterns, it seems that when O-R-D was a majority choice, those participants faced higher costs due to congestion, leading to minimum payoff.
   - If the number of agents on O-L-R-D could be limited to around 7-8 drivers—including yourself—payoffs around 150 might be a target again.
   - With 18 participants, diversifying choices seems rational. It's likely some distribution will change, so smaller groups may form on each route again.

**Decision**: Given the trends, O-L-R-D might serve as an optimal middle ground when fewer people (around 8) are anticipated on it. It has historically had the potential to yield a better payoff if less congested.

Here's the decision in JSON format:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 10:
To make an informed decision for round 10, let's analyze the data from the previous rounds and the overall structure of the game:

1. **Cost Dynamics**:
   - **O-L-D**: The cost depends on the number of drivers choosing O-L. The formula is \(10X + 210\), where \(X\) is the number of drivers who chose O-L.
   - **O-L-R-D**: The cost depends on drivers choosing O-L and R-D, so \(10X + 0 + 10Y\), where \(X\) and \(Y\) are the respective drivers on those segments.
   - **O-R-D**: The cost depends on drivers choosing R-D. As the formula is \(210 + 10Y\), where \(Y\) is the number of drivers on R-D.

2. **Summary of Costs and Payoffs in Previous Rounds**:
   - High payoffs were achieved typically when fewer drivers crowded a shared route.
   - The route O-L-R-D has been predominantly crowded as shown by consistent decreases in payoff when chosen often, particularly between rounds 1 and 9.
   - In rounds where fewer agents choose a route (like O-R-D in round 2), the payoff was higher (e.g., payoff of 150).
   
3. **Trend Analysis**:
   - There is a trend where participants tend to migrate to less crowded routes initially but tend to congregate quickly thereafter, mainly seen in the choice of O-L-R-D over many rounds.
   - If a route becomes crowded, costs increase, hence payoffs decrease.
   - O-R-D was significantly chosen when O-L-R-D became overcrowded but resulted in very low payoffs when it was overcrowded itself.

4. **Decision for Round 10**:
   - Considering historical behavior, players may shift again if one route is consistently lower in payoff. Switching to less chosen routes can offer advantages.
   - O-L-D, with fewer than average participants in recent rounds, could potentially provide a higher payoff due to potentially lower costs on the O-L segment.

By analyzing past behaviors and costs, the rational choice would be to shift back towards a route that has Fewer drivers historically to benefit from lower competition costs. Thus, I recommend choosing the route 'O-L-D'.

Here's the JSON output reflecting this decision:

```json
{
  "route": "O-L-D"
}
```

Round 11:
To make an informed decision about which route to choose for round 11, let's analyze the past rounds and the costs and payoffs associated with each route:

1. **Route Cost Structure:**
   - O-L-D: Cost = 10X + 210
   - O-L-R-D: Cost = 10X + 10Y
   - O-R-D: Cost = 210 + 10Y

2. **Round Analysis:**
   - In rounds where more agents chose O-R-D, choosing O-R-D resulted in the lowest payoff due to high cost. For example, in round 3, O-R-D resulted in very low payoff (10) because it was chosen by 17 agents.
   - Choosing O-L-R-D has resulted in varying payoffs, ranging from 80 to 150. This route tends to have moderate appeal among agents but can get costly with more users.
   - O-L-D has often resulted in lower payoffs, especially due to either higher congestion or higher fixed costs. However, it provided a relatively better payoff when less crowded.

3. **Decision Criteria:**
   - Route O-R-D is risky due to potential high cost if many agents choose it.
   - Route O-L-R-D has shown variance but remains a decent compromise in most rounds.
   - Route O-L-D could be beneficial when less crowded but potentially costly with 5+ agents.

4. **Strategy for Round 11:**
   - My previous selections indicate O-L-R-D has given me relatively consistent (though sometimes mid-range) payoffs, with the highest being 150.
   - Avoid routes like O-R-D when they are crowded.
   
5. **Prediction for Round 11:**
   - O-L-D: Moderate risk, depends on agent count.
   - O-L-R-D: Potentially the best bet to avoid extreme costs, given moderate crowds.
   - O-R-D: High risk if crowded.

Given the potential variance of routes, a balanced approach leaning towards a less congested O-L-R-D offers a safe moderate payoff, provided it's not overcrowded.

Let's choose route O-L-R-D for round 11.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 12:
To make a decision for Round 12, I'll analyze the results and trends from the previous rounds and determine the best route to choose in order to maximize my payoff (minimize travel cost).

### Analysis of Previous Rounds:

1. **Payoffs:**
   - Higher payoffs were generally received when choosing route 'O-L-R-D'. Most notably in Round 2 and Round 5, the payoffs were 150.
   - Lower payoffs occurred when choosing routes with many users, as seen in Round 3 for 'O-R-D' with a payoff of 10 and in Round 4 for 'O-L-D' with a payoff of 10.

2. **Trends in Agent Choices:**
   - Route 'O-L-R-D' tends to be the most popular choice among participants, often having consistently high numbers of agents, sometimes as high as 15 agents (Round 4).
   - Route 'O-R-D' saw high traffic in Round 3, leading to a very low payoff, but since then, it has been less popular.
   - Route 'O-L-D' varies but generally has fewer agents. However, in Round 10, it reached 5 agents with a modest payoff.

### Decision for Round 12:

To maximize my payoff in Round 12, I should avoid routes that attracted a large number of drivers in previous rounds, as more drivers on a route increase travel costs significantly due to congestion.

- **Route 'O-L-R-D'** typically attracts a high number of agents, leading to increased costs. It might be best to avoid this for now.
- **Route 'O-R-D'** could be attractive if few agents choose it, but past data shows it can get congested, leading to very high costs.
- **Route 'O-L-D'** seems to have the potential for a reasonable payoff when the number of agents remains low. Rounds where I chose this route didn't yield the highest payoff, but it wasn't too bad when the number of users was moderate.

Considering the above points and the need to reduce risk, selecting route 'O-L-D' may provide a balanced approach to achieving a reasonable payoff while avoiding congestion-related high costs.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 13:
To determine which route to choose in round 13, let's analyze the previous rounds' outcomes and consider the potential costs for each route:

1. **Route O-L-D**:
   - This route has a variable cost of 10X (where X is the number of agents choosing O-L-D) and a fixed cost of 210.
   - In the previous rounds where I chose O-L-D: 
     - Round 4: Payoff was 10 (3 agents on O-L-D)
     - Round 10: Payoff was 40 (5 agents on O-L-D)
     - Round 12: Payoff was 40 (4 agents on O-L-D)
   - The cost mostly depends on the number of agents choosing this route, but it tends to be high for this route.

2. **Route O-L-R-D**:
   - This route has a variable cost of 10X for segment O-L and a variable cost of 10Y for segment R-D, but the segment L-R has no cost.
   - Payoffs for this route varied, e.g.,:
     - Round 2: Payoff was 150 (7 agents on O-L-R-D)
     - Round 6: Payoff was 120 (10 agents on O-L-R-D)
     - Round 8: Payoff was 100 (12 agents on O-L-R-D)
   - This route often results in a medium payoff but can fluctuate depending on how many choose it.

3. **Route O-R-D**:
   - This route has a fixed cost of 210 for segment O-R and a variable cost of 10Y for segment R-D.
   - In Round 3, choosing this route resulted in the lowest payoff of 10 due to 17 agents choosing O-R-D.
   - This route is risky because if many agents choose it, it results in a high cost.

**Strategy Consideration**:
- The route O-L-R-D has been chosen frequently, obtaining varying payoffs primarily due to the number of participators. It may offer the best chance for a reasonable payoff if not too many pick it.

Given these considerations and the previous distributions of agents:

- **Route O-L-R-D has the potential to balance moderate costs** depending on the number of agents choosing both segments O-L and R-D. It usually offered better value unless overcrowded, which was frequently the case but not as severe as O-R-D.

Thus, it might be strategically beneficial to choose **O-L-R-D**, considering past payoffs and the distributions of agents so far.

Here's the decision formatted as a JSON:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 14:
To make a decision for round 14, let's analyze the data from previous rounds and strategize to minimize costs and maximize payoffs.

### Analysis of Previous Rounds:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Appears to be chosen less frequently.
   - Payoffs when chosen: 10 (R4), 40 (R10), 40 (R12).
   - Costs are high when a moderate number of people traffic this segment, leading to a lower payoff.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - The most frequently chosen route based on previous rounds.
   - Payoffs: 110 (R1), 150 (R2), 150 (R5), 120 (R6), 90 (R7), 100 (R8), 80 (R9), 80 (R11), 90 (R13).
   - Typically leads to moderate-payoff scenarios because many choose this route, leading to fluctuating costs.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Chosen least, except in R3 where everyone (17 agents) picked this route, resulting in a very low payoff (10).
   - Costs: Fixed O-R cost and competitive R-D costs with all agents who chose this.

### Strategic Consideration:

- **Trend Observation:** O-L-R-D is frequently overcrowded leading to a potential moderate payoff. O-L-D, when less crowded, has varying payoffs but due to the fixed cost on L-D it can become costly with few agents.
- **Risk with O-R-D:** Has potential for very high costs if too many choose it (due to linear R-D cost). However, choosing it when few opt for it can result in a favorable scenario due to fixed O-R cost.
- **Stability:** O-L-R-D provides stability due to just the cost of O-L varying significantly, suggesting a safer bet against volatile predictions.

### Conclusion:

Given that O-L-R-D has been the choice that has yielded consistent though moderate results across many rounds, choosing it seems like a balanced strategy considering its trade-off between stability and likelihood of overcrowding. Historically, it’s less volatile than O-R-D.

The strategy is to opt for O-L-R-D, which has historically been busier but provides predictable payoffs compared to the other routes.

Hence, for round 14:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 15:
To decide on the optimal route for Round 15, let's analyze the data from the previous rounds and examine the costs and payoffs associated with each route:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Segment O-L has a cost function of \(10 \times X\).
   - Segment L-D costs a fixed 210.
   - Payoffs when chosen:
     - Round 4: 10 (3 agents), Cost = 390
     - Round 10: 40 (5 agents), Cost = 360
     - Round 12: 40 (4 agents), Cost = 360

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Segment O-L has a cost function of \(10 \times X\).
   - Segment L-R costs 0.
   - Segment R-D has a cost function of \(10 \times Y\).
   - Payoffs when chosen:
     - Round 1: 110 (11 agents), Cost = 290
     - Round 2: 150 (7 agents), Cost = 250
     - Round 5: 150 (7 agents), Cost = 250
     - Round 6: 120 (10 agents), Cost = 280
     - Round 7: 90 (13 agents), Cost = 310
     - Round 8: 100 (12 agents), Cost = 300
     - Round 9: 80 (14 agents), Cost = 320
     - Round 11: 80 (14 agents), Cost = 320
     - Round 13: 90 (13 agents), Cost = 310
     - Round 14: 110 (11 agents), Cost = 290

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Segment O-R has a fixed cost of 210.
   - Segment R-D has a cost function of \(10 \times Y\).
   - Payoffs when chosen:
     - Round 3: 10 (17 agents), Cost = 390

**Analysis:**
- **Route O-R-D** has generally resulted in very high costs and poor payoffs when chosen.
- **Route O-L-D** seems to have similar outcomes with high costs as route O-R-D, especially as the number of agents on it increased.
- **Route O-L-R-D** has given better payoffs, particularly when the number of agents was kept lower.

**Strategy for Round 15:**
- Route O-L-R-D has provided relatively better payoffs, especially when fewer agents chose it. Most recent results indicate a preference and migration toward O-L-R-D, making the cost sensitive to increased traffic.
- Given previous rounds, a safe repeat appears for balancing between cost management and payoff maximization by selecting O-L-R-D.

Thus, the decision for Round 15 is to choose route O-L-R-D.

Here is the JSON formatted choice:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 16:
To decide which route to choose for round 16, let's analyze the past rounds and determine a strategy based on minimizing travel costs and maximizing payoff.

1. **Observations from Past Rounds:**
   - **Route O-L-R-D**: This route has been the most frequently chosen. This results in increasing congestion on segment R-D, leading to higher costs. When the number of agents on this route is high (e.g., 17 agents in round 15), the payoffs are very low due to high congestion.
   - **Route O-L-D**: This route is rarely chosen but offers consistent if not particularly high payoffs. It tends to have a stable cost, as seen in rounds where fewer agents have chosen it (e.g., only 2 or 3 people).
   - **Route O-R-D**: Even though I chose this route once, it was when 17 agents picked it as well, causing very low payoffs due to the shared segment R-D.

2. **Strategy for Round 16:**
   - **Route O-L-R-D** has been the most popular choice, increasing the risk of high congestion. Unless others move away from it, it may not be the best choice.
   - **Route O-L-D** generally remains less congested and therefore could be more consistent in offering average payoffs.
   - **Route O-R-D**: Generally results in higher costs when many agents choose it, but could be an option if most agents pivot away.

3. **Conclusion:** 
   - Given the tendency of high congestion on the O-L-R-D route and a potentially large number of drivers switching routes unpredictably, it is strategic to choose a less popular route to minimize travel cost.
   - Choose route **O-L-D** since historically, it doesn't get congested often and could lead to a more predictable payoff, especially when other players are likely avoiding this less popular route expecting high numbers on O-L-R-D or O-R-D.

Thus, for round 16, based on current dynamics and past data, choosing the route O-L-D is logical.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 17:
To determine the best route choice for round 17, let's analyze the information from the previous rounds step by step and evaluate the possible outcomes:

1. **Understanding Costs:**
   - Route O-L-D: Cost = 10X + 210.
   - Route O-L-R-D: Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y.
   - Route O-R-D: Cost = 210 + 10Y.

2. **Observing Patterns:**
   - In the rounds where you chose route O-L-R-D, the payoff varied significantly. The minimal payoff was 50 (Round 15) and the highest observed payoff was 150 in Rounds 2 and 5.
   - When you chose route O-R-D (Round 3), the crowding led to a significant loss, resulting in a very low payoff (10).
   - For the route O-L-D, the payoff varied and was comparatively lower than O-L-R-D in most instances but it had a lower variance in drivers compared to O-L-R-D.

3. **Crowding Effect:**
   - The route O-R-D typically suffered from intense crowding, as observed in Round 3.
   - O-L-R-D, although popular, often resulted in payoffs reduced due to the high number of travelers on both the O-L and R-D segments.

4. **Evaluating Choices for Round 17:**
   - Choosing O-L-R-D can be risky due to its popularity, although it has yielded decent payoffs when fewer people chose it.
   - Choosing O-R-D might not be wise given its tendency to become crowded, leading to very high costs.
   - While the payoffs from O-L-D have been moderate, its outcomes have been relatively consistent with less variability in the number of agents choosing it.

Given these considerations, choosing the O-L-D route in Round 17 may be a strategic choice, as it exposes you to less risk of extreme crowding and provides a potentially moderate and more predictable payoff.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 18:
To determine the best route choice for Round 18, we need to analyze the previous rounds and the associated payoffs for each route.

### Route Cost Analysis:
1. **Route O-L-D**: 
    - Cost: \(10X + 210\) where \(X\) = number of agents on O-L. 
    - Payoff = \(400 - (10X + 210)\)
    - Observed outcomes:
        - Round 10: 5 agents -> Payoff 40
        - Round 12: 4 agents -> Payoff 40
        - Round 16: 5 agents -> Payoff 50
        - Rarely had more than 5 agents, but with 5 the payoff is quite low (around 40-50).

2. **Route O-L-R-D**:
    - Cost: \(10X + 0 + 10Y\) where \(X\) = number of agents O-L and \(Y\) = number of agents R-D.
    - Payoff = \(400 - (10X + 10Y)\)
    - Observed outcomes:
        - Generally has high variability in number of agents, primarily 9-14 agents result in varied payoffs:
            - Rounds 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14: Payoffs ranged from 80 to 150.
            - Often when 13-14 take this route, the payoff drops significantly (with 80 being frequently observed).
        - Rounds with lower numbers (around 11 agents) resulted in better payoffs like 110, 120, 150.

3. **Route O-R-D**:
    - Cost: \(210 + 10Y\), \(Y\) = number of agents on R-D.
    - Observed outcomes:
        - Rarely chosen, usually yielding very few agents and high individual costs.
        - Most consistent when a few agents (like in Round 3), but still resulted in a low payoff (10).

### Strategic Decision for Round 18:
- **Route Preference**:
    - **O-L-R-D** has the potential for a higher payoff when it's less crowded (11 or fewer agents), but becomes costlier with increased agents.
    - **O-L-D** tends to be a solid choice when less crowded (3 or fewer agents), but isn’t preferred when it approaches 5 or more agents due to lower payoffs.
    - **O-R-D** has shown consistently poor payoffs when chosen in abundance.

- In recent rounds, O-L-R-D had a larger fluctuation in participants, but offers higher potential payoffs when close to 11 agents. However, as more players join, the payoff drops.
- **Choosing O-L-D** might be more beneficial in this round considering the historical data, where it occasionally garnered fewer participants leading to better payoffs than its average. 

**Conclusion**: Given the summary data, choosing **O-L-D** offers a safer option with potential for better payoffs, assuming it has lower participation as observed occasionally. 

Here's the schema-conforming output:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 19:
To make an informed decision for round 19, I'll analyze the previous rounds' data to discern any patterns or trends in route selections and their respective payoffs.

1. **Route O-L-R-D**: 
   - This route is commonly chosen, as evident from the frequency (often 11 to 14 agents), but typically results in moderate to low payoffs when crowded. 
   - The best payoff of 150 was when only 7 agents took this route in round 2.
   - In contrast, higher numbers (11-17) of agents on this route tend to decrease the payoff due to increased congestion costs.

2. **Route O-L-D**:
   - This route has mixed results. When chosen, the number of agents ranges from 0 to 11. 
   - Payoffs have been low, typically 40-50, with an exception of 10 in round 4.
   - The average agent number seems to be around 4, which shows moderate usage and moderate congestion.

3. **Route O-R-D**:
   - This route, although not chosen as frequently, offers a constant cost due to a fixed route segment and a variable segment.
   - The analysis from round 3 shows a poor payoff of 10 when 17 agents chose this route.

**Analysis of Trends**:
- **Route Popularity & Costs**: 'O-L-R-D' is generally popular but quickly gets congested, reducing payoffs when the number of agents is higher. 
- **'O-L-D' and 'O-R-D' often draw fewer participants, thus posing potential for moderate profit with less congestion.

**Strategy**:
- Given that 'O-L-D' and 'O-R-D' can result in better payoffs when less crowded, the key is to anticipate other drivers' behaviors.
- Since 'O-L-R-D' is often crowded, it might be reasonable to select 'O-L-D', hoping that the majority again overlooks this option in their pursuit of the popular 'O-L-R-D.'

Based on this understanding, I will choose:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 20:
To make a well-informed decision, let's analyze the previous rounds and the corresponding payoffs for each route choice. Our goal is to maximize the payoff, i.e., minimize the travel cost.

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Payoff results: 10, 40, 50, 40, 50, 30
   - This route involves a variable cost depending on the number of agents choosing O-L. Historically, the payoff has been consistently lower than when choosing O-L-R-D when fewer agents selected this path.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Payoff results: 110, 150, 150, 120, 90, 100, 80, 80, 90, 110, 50
   - This route usually has a fixed cost at L-R and becomes beneficial when fewer people choose O-L. Payoff tends to decrease as more agents share the route, but it has had some of the highest payoffs compared to other routes, especially when fewer agents (7-11) are on O-L.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Payoff result: 10
   - Route O-R-D's only result had the lowest payoff due to a high number of agents (17) using segment R-D. It’s usually less favorable if many agents choose it.

**Current Analysis:**
- An emerging pattern shows that choosing O-L-R-D usually provides a higher payoff due to the zero additional cost on the L-R segment and reasonable control over occupants on segment O-L.
- Historically, Route O-L-R-D outperformed others more often, especially when fewer agents chose it (around 7-11).

**Prediction Strategy for Round 20:**
- Avoid Route O-R-D based on previous high costs due to increased competition on R-D.
- Choosing O-L-R-D tends to be beneficial based on historical payoffs especially when agents spread over routes O-L-D and O-L-R-D, which they have been doing recently.

**Decision:**
Route O-L-R-D has consistently provided better or comparable payoffs, considering recent agent behaviors preferring to distribute themselves between two primary routes (O-L-D and O-L-R-D), leaving O-R-D less attractive. 

Therefore, let's choose Route O-L-R-D again:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 21:
To select a route for round 21, we should analyze the previous rounds' outcomes in terms of the number of agents choosing each route and the payoffs received for choosing different routes. Here's a brief analysis of the results:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - This route has been selected many times, but often results in a low payoff.
   - This route was chosen in rounds 4, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18, and 19. The payoffs for these rounds were 10, 40, 40, 50, 40, 50, and 30, respectively.
   - Interestingly, there were instances when choosing O-L-D resulted in a slightly better payoff (such as rounds 16 and 18) but generally yielded lower results.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - This route has been selected most frequently.
   - The payoffs when choosing this route ranged from 50 to 150, with a median around 90-110.
   - This route tends to group a larger number of agents, typically around 10-14.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - This route was chosen only twice, in rounds 3 and 5. The resulting payoffs were 10 and 150, respectively.
   - The major concern is that this route often leads to high congestion on segment R-D (like in round 3 when 17 agents chose it).

Observations:
- While route O-L-R-D didn't always provide the highest payoff, it often gave a stable range of payoffs.
- The route O-L-D often resulted in lower payoffs, possibly due to congestion on segment O-L.
- Route O-R-D is the least chosen and results can be very unpredictable. It either results in relatively low or high payoff but is often overcrowded as well.

Given these observations and considering we want to minimize costs and thus maximize payoffs, the best strategy is to choose the route that has shown relatively stable payoffs with a mid-level congestion. Hence, I choose:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 22:
To choose the optimal route for round 22, let's analyze the data from the previous rounds focusing on the cost structure and agent distribution for each route:

1. **Route O-L-D**:
   - Costs 10X + 210.
   - Historically, this route has had between 0 and 5 agents.
   - The typical cost when choosing this route has been relatively high compared to the endowment (payoffs between 10 and 50 when chosen).

2. **Route O-L-R-D**:
   - Costs 10X + 0 + 10Y.
   - This route has attracted the majority of agents most rounds, often seeing between 7 to 15 drivers.
   - Payoffs when choosing this route have fluctuated, but it seems to yield a balance between high costs and the possibility for a moderate payoff (as low as 50, as high as 150).
  
3. **Route O-R-D**:
   - Costs 210 + 10Y.
   - It has not been popular, except in one instance when 17 agents chose it.
   - Payoffs have been very low when it's been chosen or heavily used (as low as 10).

**Recent Trends**:
- Route O-L-R-D tends to be the frequently chosen route.
- Route O-R-D has seen the least use of late, possibly indicating that it might sometimes be a good choice if few others choose it.
- Route O-L-D has been consistently occupied but provides generally low payoffs.

**Strategy for Round 22**:
Given the fluctuating nature and unpredictability of other agents, a strategy might involve choosing the least predictable choice where there is potentially low competition. However, Route O-R-D seems riskier given its cost pattern. The safest moderate-risk-best-payoff choice, historically speaking, would be O-L-R-D.

Given this, I will choose:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 23:
To make a better decision for Round 23, let's analyze the data from previous rounds.

1. **Trend Analysis**:
   - From the summary, we notice a recurring high volume of drivers choosing the route "O-L-R-D". This increases the cost as more drivers choose the same route, making this option less cost-effective.
   - Both routes "O-L-D" and "O-R-D" have fluctuated in terms of driver count. However, the "O-R-D" route has often been less chosen, except when there is a specific trend like in Round 3, where it had 17 drivers (a significant high).

2. **Payoffs**:
   - When selecting "O-L-R-D", the payoff has varied, but it generally trends lesser when the number of drivers is 13 or more.
   - The "O-L-D" route sometimes provides low costs when there are fewer drivers (like in Rounds 19 and 20) but tends to get crowded.
   - The "O-R-D" hasn't been chosen as frequently but offered a viable payoff in Round 3 when only a single agent chose "O-L-R-D" instead.

3. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Given that "O-L-R-D" consistently has a high number of drivers, it might be wise to avoid it unless there's a notable drop in users.
   - "O-R-D" remains an interesting choice if fewer drivers decide on it, as static costs are involved but can spike with high usage.
   - "O-L-D" seems to have fewer drivers recently but offers decent payoffs only if the count remains low.

4. **Decision for Round 23**:
   - Choosing a route that others are less likely to choose could result in a lower travel cost. Historically, "O-R-D" and "O-L-D" can provide a better payoff when they are under-utilized.
   - Noticing from the data, it seems other participants haven't strongly favored "O-R-D" recently. This could be a good gamble to try.

Based on previous rounds' outcomes and potential payoffs, opting for "O-R-D" could be a strategic decision, anticipating fewer players might choose it, keeping costs low.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 24:
To choose the optimal route for round 24, we need to consider the past data and the routes available. The goal is to maximize payoff, which is achieved by minimizing travel costs. Let's consider the costs associated with each route and the trends from previous rounds:

1. **Route O-L-D**:
   - Travel cost is calculated as: \(10X + 210\)
   - From the above data, when fewer drivers choose this route, the travel cost is lower since \(X\) (number of drivers on O-L) decreases. Low values observed for X were 2 or 3, resulting in payoffs of 50 or 40.

2. **Route O-L-R-D**:
   - Travel cost formula: \(10X + 0 + 10Y\)
   - Popular when the O-L segment is chosen by 10 or more, generally leading to lower payoffs. However, some rounds with fewer on R-D gave slight improvements.

3. **Route O-R-D**:
   - Constant cost, with cost formula: \(210 + 10Y\)
   - High competition on R-D leads to high costs, recorded payoff of only 10 when route was crowded in round 3, and poor results in round 23 with a payoff of 50.

**Past Patterns**:
- Route O-L-R-D often gets crowded, resulting in low payoffs when drivers number is high (e.g., rounds 9 and 15).
- Route O-R-D had very low payoffs when all crowded on it (round 3), but better results compared to O-L-R-D when numbers were even (round 23).
- Route O-L-D fares best when competition on O-L is manageable. Payoffs improve when the number on O-L remains lower.

**Current decision**:
- Based on trends, Route O-L-R-D frequently leads to suboptimal results due to high participant concentration.
- Route O-R-D seems risky unless fewer overall choose it.
- Route O-L-D has shown better results when rider numbers remain low to moderate.

Considering these, I should select Route O-L-D since it has potential for better performance when fewer riders select it, and there's a possibility others may alternate given the past few rounds' patterns.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 25:
In order to make a strategic decision for round 25, let's review the past performance and trends:

1. **Routes and Costs**:
   - **O-L-D**: Cost = 10X + 210
   - **O-L-R-D**: Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y
   - **O-R-D**: Cost = 210 + 10Y

2. **Past Performance**:
   - Generally, choosing route O-L-R-D has given varied payoffs, ranging from moderate to low, due to the fact that it can accumulate higher numbers of drivers, leading to higher congestion and costs.
   - Route O-R-D tends to be less chosen by others but can also result in extremely high costs when many agents simultaneously decide to switch to it, as seen in rounds 3 and 23.
   - Route O-L-D generally has some drivers and offers a moderate cost, but the payoff is often low compared to the ideal potential.

3. **Driver Behavior Trends**:
   - There seems to be shifting behavior, with drivers experimenting between O-L-D and O-L-R-D with fluctuating numbers on O-R-D.
   - The number of drivers on the segment O-R-D tends to vary significantly, indicating potential risk if many drivers suddenly switch to this route.

4. **Decision Consideration**:
   - Choosing O-L-D or O-L-R-D typically results in similar congestion patterns, though O-L-R-D provides flexibility in case few drivers choose R-D subsequently.
   - O-R-D has proven to be risky, with high payoffs achievable only if it is less crowded, which has been unpredictable.

Based on these observations, for round 25, I will avoid O-R-D due to its inconsistency and high penalty when crowded. The choice between O-L-D and O-L-R-D is crucial. 

O-L-D gives consistent, albeit lower payoffs. O-L-R-D offers a chance for a larger payoff if the segment R-D remains less congested. However, this is usually balanced out by the congestion on O-L.

Considering recent rounds where O-L-R-D seems to have a significant number of agents, I'll opt for **O-L-R-D** with the expectation that congestion on route R-D might be balanced.

Let's decide:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 26:
To make an informed decision for round 26, let's analyze the data from previous rounds step-by-step:

1. **Route Analysis**:
   - There are three routes available: 'O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', and 'O-R-D'.
   - The routes O-L-D and O-L-R-D depend on how many other drivers choose the same segments as they share segment O-L.
   - O-R-D has been less crowded but when crowded (like in round 3), it leads to high costs.

2. **Cost & Payoff Trends**:
   - High payoffs (150) were achieved with O-L-R-D in rounds where fewer drivers (7) were on it, like round 2.
   - The payoff decreases significantly when O-L-R-D is chosen by more than 10 drivers due to increased congestion on O-L and R-D segments.
   - O-R-D can be low cost but risky if heavily populated as seen in round 3.
   - O-L-D provides moderate outcomes and occasional higher payoffs when it's less populated (3-4 drivers) but often results in lower payoffs when 5 or more drivers choose it, likely due to higher congestion on segment O-L.

3. **Crowd patterns**:
   - There seems to be a tendency for O-L-R-D to attract more drivers, often reaching over 10 drivers, leading to higher costs.
   - O-L-D sometimes sees spikes in users but hasn't reached above 5 recently.
   - O-R-D hasn't been utilized much in later rounds, implying risk but potentially low cost if few choose it.

4. **Strategic Decision**:
   - Going with O-L-R-D has provided fairly balanced payoffs when not too crowded, but there's a risk as it often goes above 10 drivers.
   - O-L-D provides stability with less fluctuation but often at a slightly lower payoff.
   - O-R-D could be a riskier high-reward option if it's assumed others shy away from it, especially after round 3's example.

By considering these points, selecting 'O-L-D' might be the safest choice, with a potential for a balanced or slightly higher payoff due to its recent medium congestion and consistent output. 

Here is the JSON object that represents this choice:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 27:
To make an informed decision about selecting a route for round 27, let's analyze the previous round outcomes to determine the most viable choice. The goal is to maximize our payoff by minimizing travel costs. We have three potential routes: 'O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', and 'O-R-D'. Here's the step-by-step breakdown based on the data from prior rounds:

1. **Evaluate Route O-L-D:**
   - This route's cost is subject to variability due to 10X cost from segment O-L, with a fixed cost of 210 from segment L-D.
   - Historical payoff for choosing this route has ranged from 30 to 50 points in recent rounds, which is quite low.
   - The frequent number of agents on this route has been between 3 and 5, indicating a consistent but low usage compared to others.
   
2. **Evaluate Route O-L-R-D:**
   - The cost on this route is dependent on both segment O-L and R-D with 10X cost and a middle section with 0 cost.
   - The payoffs when choosing this route have fluctuated widely, with outcomes ranging from 50 to 150 points.
   - It appears to be the most popular route with agent numbers primarily between 9 to 15, indicating significant congestion.

3. **Evaluate Route O-R-D:**
   - This route has a fixed cost of 210 for segment O-R and variable 10Y cost for the final segment R-D.
   - Historically, the payoff ranges have been low when choosing this route, from 10 to 50 points, and the choice was least common among agents.
   - The use of this route tends to be low, sometimes with as few as 0-5 agents.

**Conclusion:**
- Given the high variability and congestion on the O-L-R-D route alongside recent moderate payoffs and the consistent low payoff history associated with O-R-D, the challenge becomes finding a balance between congestion and payoff.
- The O-L-D route, while also varying, seems less frequently traveled recently in rounds where payoffs have approached reasonable figures suggesting a possible freeing up of that segment. Its relatively low number of users compared to O-L-R-D could lead to less congestion now.
- Based on these observations, choosing route 'O-L-D' could be strategic if recent patterns hold, minimizing variable costs due to lower participant numbers.

Decision: I will choose route 'O-L-D' for this round. 

Here's the formatted JSON output:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 28:
To make a decision for Route 28, let's analyze the data from previous rounds and consider the costs associated with each route.

1. **Routes and Costs:**
   - **O-L-D:** Cost = 10X + 210
   - **O-L-R-D:** Cost = 10X + 10Y + 0 (where traveling cost through L-R is always 0)
   - **O-R-D:** Cost = 210 + 10Y

2. **Historical Analysis:**
   - In rounds where I chose **O-L-R-D**, there were varied results. For instance:
     - In Round 1, with 11 agents choosing the same, the payoff was 110.
     - In Round 13, with 13 agents, the payoff was 90.
   
   - In rounds where I chose **O-L-D**, the payoffs were generally lower:
     - Example: Round 19, with 3 agents, payoff was 30.

   - Choosing **O-R-D** typically results in higher costs unless very few people choose that route, which hasn't been the trend lately:
     - In Round 3, 17 agents led to a payoff of just 10.
     - In Round 23, even with fewer agents (4), the payoff was only 50.

3. **Observations on Others’ Behaviors:**
   - The path **O-L-R-D** is consistently chosen by many. However, individuals tend to alternate slightly between the three options.
   - The rounds with relatively fewer agents on **O-L-R-D** and more on **O-L-D** resulted in slightly better outcomes for **O-L-D**. 
   - Generally, **O-R-D** was rarely chosen in recent rounds, hinting at a potential switch by others due to historically bad returns.

4. **Strategic Decision:**
   - **O-L-R-D** frequently provides moderate returns, often more consistent than **O-L-D** and **O-R-D**.
   - **O-L-D** seems riskier given its potential dependency on the number of agents and historical lower returns recently.
   - Given recent patterns, many agents opted for **O-L-R-D**, scaling costs. A strategic choice would avoid a route that most participants might default to after poor experiences elsewhere.

**Prediction for Round 28:**
- **O-L-R-D** might still be a better option due to lower cumulative costs even with more agents, and with the recent tendency, the agent count on **O-R-D** might remain low.

Therefore, the optimal choice based on historical data and potential variance in agent decisions is likely to go with **O-L-R-D**.

Here's the decision formatted in the required JSON schema:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 29:
To make an informed decision for Round 29, let's analyze the data from previous rounds to try and predict the best route choice that will minimize travel costs and maximize payoff.

1. **Route Analysis**:
   - **Route O-L-D**:
     - Costs depend on how many agents choose this route since it has a cost function on O-L (10X).
     - Previous payoffs when taking this route have been as low as 30 and as high as 50. The cost tends to increase when more than 3 agents choose this route.
   
   - **Route O-L-R-D**:
     - Has a fluctuating cost due to the shared segment R-D.
     - Provides a moderate payoff usually ranging from 70 to 150 but can dip lower when many agents choose this route. For instance, the payoff was as low as 50 in Round 15 with 17 agents on route.
   
   - **Route O-R-D**:
     - Fixed cost for O-R (210) and variable for R-D (10Y).
     - This route has seen high congestion, particularly in rounds with low payoffs.
   
2. **Recent Trends**:
   - Route O-L-R-D has had the largest fluctuation in total agents, often being in the double digits.
   - Route O-L-D has not exceeded 5 agents in the recent rounds, likely making it the least congested route at this point.
   - Route O-R-D has not been picked often, potentially due to high travel costs as seen in Round 3.

3. **Conclusion and Decision**:
   - Choosing Route O-L-D might provide the most stable payoff given the relatively low congestion based on recent rounds.
   - This route has consistently had fewer than 6 agents choosing it, allowing for a manageable cost from congestion.

Based on this analysis, the chosen route should be O-L-D. Here is the JSON object reflecting this decision:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 30:
To make an informed decision, let's consider the travel costs associated with each route and the patterns observed in prior rounds:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost: \(10X + 210\)
   - Payoffs from previous rounds were consistently low, indicating a high number of drivers choosing this route. Ideally, this choice is efficient if fewer agents choose this route.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Cost: \(10X + 0 + 10Y\)
   - This route was often chosen, and payoffs varied. Payoffs were relatively good (above 90) when the number of drivers on this route was around 10-12. More agents, pattern indicating congestion.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost: \(210 + 10Y\)
   - This route resulted in a positive payoff when fewer agents chose it. A strategic retreat if a low number of agents is expected here.

**Assessment of Prior Choices:**
- **O-L-R-D**: Selected frequently, offering moderate payoffs when congestion was managed (10-12 agents).
- **O-L-D**: Past rounds show minimal payoff possibly due to popularity.
- **O-R-D**: Could result in high payoffs if few agents choose this route.

**Strategic Choice for Round 30:**
Given a consistent congestion on the O-L-R-D route with fluctuating numbers, and a potential high cost on O-L-D due to variability in agents choosing this path, O-R-D might become advantageous if less chosen by others. However, given patterns of past rounds, this remains uncertain.

Aim to target:
- **O-L-R-D** if anticipating medium congestion (8-10 agents here).
- **O-R-D** as a high-risk/high-reward path if estimating fewer than 5 agents take it.

Opting for **O-L-R-D** is likely safer, striking a workload balance.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 31:
To make a strategic decision on which route to choose in round 31, we need to consider the past rounds' data, identifying any regular patterns or trends in route selection and the resulting payoffs.

1. **Analyzing Previous Rounds:**
   - **Route O-L-D**: Generally, this route has been associated with a smaller pool of agents (usually around 2 to 5), resulting in moderate costs, but not often very high payoffs due to the fixed additional cost of 210 for the segment L-D.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**: This route has been chosen frequently, with the number of agents usually ranging from 9 to 15. This route tends to offer varied payoffs depending on the congestion but can lead to a payoff around 80 to 110 when there are 12 or fewer agents.
   - **Route O-R-D**: This route, when chosen by fewer agents, in theory could offer potential lower costs, but has also led to low payoffs when 17 agents chose this route in round 3.

2. **Identifying Trends:**
   - The most chosen route appears to be O-L-R-D. However, it can provide decent payoffs when not too heavily congested.
   - O-R-D has the potential for a low cost but can be risky if others predict and over-select.
   - Route O-L-D can be relatively stable with consistent moderate choices, but it's not particularly advantageous if chosen by more than two others.

3. **Strategic Consideration:**
   - Maximizing payoff while managing risk is crucial. We're looking for a route that offers a reasonable chance of a good payoff without significant risk of overcrowding.
   - Given that Route O-L-R-D often has a balanced payoff when not overly populated, it might be advantageous if we expect others to return to O-R-D after noticing consistent overcrowding in O-L-R-D.

4. **Decision for Round 31:**
   - Choose a route that provides a balance between a moderate number of users and avoiding the most historically popular (and thus crowded) option.
   - Based on the analysis, choosing **O-L-R-D** appears optimal as it often avoids extreme overcrowding and still traditionally provides a higher payoff potential compared to the riskier and less frequently rewarding O-R-D.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 32:
To determine the best route to choose for Round 32, I need to consider the previous rounds' data and analyze the costs and payoffs associated with each route:

1. **Routes and Cost Functions**:
   - O-L-D: Cost is variable (10X + 210 for segment L-D).
   - O-L-R-D: Cost is variable for segment O-L (10X) and for segment R-D (10Y) but segment O-R is fixed at 0.
   - O-R-D: Cost is fixed at 210 for segment O-R and variable for segment R-D (10Y).

2. **Observations and Trends**:
   - O-L-D: In many rounds, choosing this route resulted in lower payoffs (as low as 10 to 50), indicating higher variable costs on segment O-L due to competition and congestion.
   - O-L-R-D: This route has sometimes been the most balanced in terms of payoff, especially when fewer agents selected it. Payoff has generally ranged higher, between 50 and 150.
   - O-R-D: Generally consistent high-cost rounds indicated by low payoffs (e.g., payoffs as low as 10 or 50), suggesting this route often faces significant congestion on segment R-D when few drivers select other options.

3. **Implications**:
   - Route O-R-D, although initially attractive with its fixed 210 cost segment, becomes costly when a large number of agents congest segment R-D.
   - Route O-L-D can become costly under congestion, as seen from various rounds where the payoff was low.
   - Route O-L-R-D, though sometimes slightly congested, has shown resilience in payoffs, particularly when the number of agents is moderate.

4. **Choosing the Route**:
   - Based on previous patterns and payoffs, O-L-R-D emerges as a route that can be less congested compared to others, resulting in higher payoffs.
   - Considering the past rounds where O-L-R-D showed good results (e.g., Rounds 20, 28, 30), it's reasonable to anticipate Round 32 might follow similar trends.

Thus, for Round 32, the route decision should take into account strategic use of less congested paths for potential payoff maximization. 

Given this analysis, I choose the route:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 33:
To make a decision for round 33, let's analyze the data from previous rounds:

1. **Payoffs and Routes**: The past rounds have shown varying payoffs depending on the chosen route and the number of agents choosing each route. High participation on a segment increases its cost, reducing the payoff.

2. **Route Performance Analysis**:
   - **O-L-D**: 
     - Low payoff when many agents (5 or more) choose this route (e.g., Rounds 10, 16, 18, 19, 24, 26).
     - Slightly better payback (40-50 range) when fewer agents (2 to 4) choose it.
   - **O-L-R-D**: 
     - Generally provides moderate payoff (70 to 150) when the number of agents is around 7 to 12.
     - Low payoff (50-80) when the number of agents exceeds 13.
     - Often chosen by many agents, leading to fluctuating results.
   - **O-R-D**: 
     - Consistently performs poorly when many agents (over 10) choose it (e.g., Round 3).
     - Better payoffs when fewer agents are on this route, but very variable.

3. **Trend Insights**:
   - **Segment O-L and Segment R-D****: Both segments impact the travel cost significantly when crowded.
   - High-cost route **O-R-D** seems less attractive unless it is highly underused by others (e.g., rare in given data).
   - **O-L-R-D** has been a somewhat balanced choice when 7-12 other agents are traveling with you.
   - **O-L-D** tends to be cost-effective with fewer agents, performing decently in isolated cases.

4. **Strategic Decision**:
   - Considering the frequent crossover between O-L and R-D paths, **O-L-R-D** seems to offer relatively stable outcomes when too many competitors don't overpopulate it (i.e., between 7 to 12 competitors).
   - Currently, there's instability in all routes seeing coinciding high numbers.

5. **Conclusion for Choice**:
   - To maximize payoff considering trends and uncertainty, the best course will be to again opt for **O-L-R-D**. It has delivered relatively better and predictable results with moderate agent-number deployments.

Based on this analysis, here is the decision represented in the required JSON format:
```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 34:
To make an informed decision on which route to choose in round 34, let's analyze the historical data along with the costs associated with each segment of the routes. Our goal is to minimize costs and maximize payoff from the 400-point endowment. 

1. **Cost Analysis:**

   - **Route O-L-D**:
     - Cost = 10X + 210 where X is the number of users choosing O-L.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**:
     - Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Z where X is the number of users choosing O-L and Z is the number of users choosing R-D.
   - **Route O-R-D**:
     - Cost = 210 + 10Y where Y is the number of users choosing R-D.

2. **Review of Historical Choices:**

   - High number of agents generally choose the O-L-R-D route, making the costs higher due to congestion on both O-L and R-D segments.
   - O-L-D route also had variable congestion, occasionally providing better payoffs but often close in cost to the endowment limit.
   - Past attempts to use O-R-D resulted in significant costs if many participants selected it.

3. **Recent Trends:**

   - In Round 33, 15 agents chose O-L-R-D leading to a payoff of 70, indicating reasonable congestion effects.
   - There are periods where O-L has only a few users, suggesting potential under-utilization of route O-L-D.
   - In previous rounds, both O-L-D and O-L-R-D routes were frequently selected, thus future participants may consider O-R-D to reduce individual costs.

4. **Decision for Round 34:**

   Based on the current trends and the desire to maximize payoffs by minimizing costs, choosing a route with lower anticipated users can be beneficial. Historical data shows that the O-L-D route can occasionally offer better payoffs when users are fewer. While O-L-R-D sees regular heavy usage, O-R-D could be risky due to unpredictable participation on the R-D segment.

Given these insights, a cautious approach would be to attempt route **O-L-D** in anticipation of lower participation:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 35:
To make an informed decision for round 35, let's analyze the trends and payoffs from the previous rounds:

1. **Analyze Trends:**
   - **O-L-D:** Payoffs range between 10 and 50. The route tends to have relatively fewer agents and stable costs but rarely produces high payoffs.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Payoffs mostly range between 50 and 150. This route is popular hence costs can be high when many agents choose it, leading to lower payoffs sometimes. However, when the number of agents is managed well, it can lead to moderate payoffs.
   - **O-R-D:** Has extremely variable payoffs. Payoffs can be as low as 10 or reasonably high, such as 50 in round 23. The payoff mainly depends on the number of agents choosing this route.

2. **Decision Factors:**
   - During rounds when fewer agents chose O-L-D or O-R-D, O-L-R-D was able to yield better payoffs due to moderate competition/risk balancing.
   - Choosing O-L-R-D guarantees a more middle-ground station and has the flexibility of reduced expenses when fewer drivers prefer expensive segments.

3. **Predict competitors' behavior:**
   - O-L-R-D has been the dominant strategy in many rounds, suggesting competitors might expect high costs, avoiding it.
   - It is likely to assume many agents might opt not to travel O-L-R-D this time, moving to routes O-L-D or O-R-D in search of lower congestion, especially since O-L-R-D costs increased in recent rounds.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - As O-L-D sometimes leads to lower payoffs, trying O-L-R-D in anticipation of lower competition due to others possibly switching could be beneficial.
   - It is a calculated risk that considers the averaging trend of agents in each option while staying aware of the volatility.

Given the above analysis, choosing "O-L-R-D" may provide a favorable balance in payoff, capitalizing on the behavioral expectation that competitors seek the less obvious but potentially predictable choices.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 36:
To make an informed decision for round 36, we need to evaluate the previous rounds and identify patterns or insights that can help minimize travel costs.

### Analysis of Previous Rounds:
1. **Route O-L-D**:
   - This route has fluctuating costs depending on how many agents choose it.
   - When the number of agents is around 3 or more, the payoff can be as low as 30 or 40 points.
   
2. **Route O-L-R-D**:
   - This route is often congested with many agents (usually above 10).
   - When more than 14 agents choose this route, payoffs can drop significantly (e.g., 50 points).

3. **Route O-R-D**:
   - Rarely chosen, but very costly if not chosen by a few (high payoffs only if few others choose it).
   - High costs when almost all agents (upwards of 16 or 17) choose it, driving the costs up drastically. A previous choice for this route resulted in a very low payoff when heavily congested.

### Current Strategy:
- The goal is to choose the route with the fewest other agents or anticipate their choice to avoid congested routes.
- **Route O-L-D** might be worth considering if we anticipate that other agents choose the currently popular O-L-R-D. However, this route becomes disadvantageous when heavily populated.
- **Route O-L-R-D** generally appears as a default choice with average payoffs. While it's more populated, choosing this route when others shift to O-L-D might result in a favorable outcome if congestion is avoided.
- **Route O-R-D** can only be beneficial with very few participants choosing it, based on previous patterns.

Given these insights, it's a balancing act between predicting the paths others will take and the historical data on payoffs. Ideally, avoiding congestion by making a slightly riskier choice contrary to the popular route is beneficial if prediction is accurate. However, given the high variability and potential penalties in costs, sticking to the less popular but predictable route might optimize payoff.

**Decision:**
I'll choose route O-L-R-D, as it has historically yielded better results. Although it often sees high traffic, the associated payoff compared to others has been more consistent. A strategic choice aims to avoid congestion on O-L-D and capitalizes on the predictability of O-L-R-D's traffic behavior among agents.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 37:
To select the most optimal route for round 37, we need to analyze the data from previous rounds, focusing on the route choices and the corresponding payoffs. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Route Options and Cost Functions:**
   - **O-L-D:** Cost = 10X + 210
   - **O-L-R-D:** Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y
   - **O-R-D:** Cost = 210 + 10Y

2. **Historical Performance Evaluation:**
   - **O-L-D:** The payoffs tend to range between 10 and 50. This indicates that when chosen by more than a few agents (3-5), this route often results in a lower payoff.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Payoffs in this route range from 50 to 150. Notably, higher payoffs occur when the agents choosing this route are fewer (e.g., 7 to 9).
   - **O-R-D:** Few data points, but notably, choosing this route when few agents opt for it results in higher payoffs (e.g., round 3 yielded a payoff of 10 when it was chosen by 17 agents, indicating high congestion).
   
3. **Identifying Patterns:**
   - The O-L-R-D route provides a more consistent and often higher payoff than the O-L-D route, except in cases of very high congestion.
   - The pattern suggests that often the O-L-R-D route, when less congested, is advantageous due to the fixed cost of the L-R segment being zero.

4. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - Based on previous rounds, when O-L-R-D has around 9 to 12 agents, it tends to provide a better payoff, often over 100.
   - Last round choice for O-L-R-D was successful (payoff of 130 with 9 agents taking it).

5. **Decision:**
   Given these observations, I will choose the O-L-R-D again for round 37, considering it tends to provide the best balance when moderately chosen by peers.

Following this analysis, the decision according to the schema is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 38:
To make an informed decision, let's analyze the results from the past rounds.

1. **Route Costs and Payoffs**:
   - **O-L-D**: Highly variable costs. At times, it results in a low payoff (as low as 30) suggesting a high cost due to more drivers. The payoff was higher when fewer drivers chose this route.
   - **O-L-R-D**: The payoffs have been somewhat more consistent, typically ranging from 50 to 150. The optimal conditions seem to arise when fewer than 12 agents choose this route.
   - **O-R-D**: Rarely chosen. Historical data shows extreme costs due to high congestion when chosen by many.

2. **Drivers Patterns and Their Effect**:
   - **O-L-D** sees variable participation, resulting in inconsistency in payoff due to congestion. It is typically chosen by 2-5 agents.
   - **O-L-R-D** is often chosen but becomes less favorable when more than 12 agents participate. 
   - **O-R-D**: Rarely chosen, high cost when many agents choose this route.

3. **Recent Trends**:
   - Despite previous high participation in O-L-R-D, recent rounds show a leaning towards reducing congestion (approximately 12-13 agents consistently) making it sometimes favorable but dropping when over 14 agents.
   - O-L-D was selected frequently in earlier rounds and didn't often yield high payoffs due to congestion. 

4. **Round 37 Analysis**:
   - Round 37 showed O-L-R-D with 80 payoff with 14 drivers. 
   - This suggests that costs are being shared by multiple agents, but it is nearing a threshold where it might not remain favorable.

Based on these observations, the route O-L-R-D has a relatively stable outcome given the current agent distribution. However, given the payoff drop when more than 14 agents choose this route, if you can anticipate lower participation, it might yield a better payoff than O-L-D. O-R-D remains riskier given historical congestion spikes.

Deciding on a strategy:
- **O-L-R-D**: Aiming for a situation where around 12 agents choose this might be beneficial. However, it's crucial to anticipate the decision of others.
- **O-L-D**: A fallback if other routes seem too congested, but wary of congestion in the next rounds.

Let's choose **O-L-R-D** for round 38:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 39:
To make a decision for Round 39, let's analyze the data from previous rounds:

1. **Route Costs:**
   - **O-L-D:** Cost = \(10 \times X + 210\)
   - **O-L-R-D:** Cost = \(10 \times X + 0 + 10 \times Y\)
   - **O-R-D:** Cost = \(210 + 10 \times Y\)

2. **Previous Performance:**
   - I've mostly chosen route O-L-R-D with varying payoffs, typically higher than other routes.
   - Occasional attempts at O-L-D and O-R-D routes resulted in generally lower payoffs.

3. **Observed Traffic Patterns:**
   - O-L-R-D has consistently experienced higher congestion.
   - O-R-D has been mostly avoided, likely due to high fixed costs with increased congestion when several drivers switch to it.
   - Fluctuations exist in the congestion for O-L-D, showing variability in traffic.

4. **Recent Trends:**
   - In the most recent rounds (36-38), O-L-R-D has provided decent payoffs (130, 80, 100), indicating that the other players might be distributing their choices, reducing optimal congestion.

5. **Strategy:**
   - Given the historical data, opting for O-L-R-D appears to have favorable outcomes more frequently than the alternatives.
   - Congestion on O-L-R-D leads to high costs when almost all participants choose it, yet it balances out when there's a slight distribution across the three routes.
   - The recent behavior of other participants suggests a normalizing distribution.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Choosing O-L-R-D seems strategic due to its potential for lower cost when not overly congested with 14-17 participants.
   - It offers flexibility with segments (O-L-R) which could balance transportation costs better on average.

Here is the decision for Round 39 based on the above analysis:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 40:
To make an informed decision for round 40, I will analyze the data from previous rounds and evaluate the possible choices:

1. **Understanding Cost Functions and Payoffs:**
   - The cost for route 'O-L-D' is `10X + 210`.
   - The cost for route 'O-L-R-D' is `10X + 0 + 10Y`.
   - The cost for route 'O-R-D' is `210 + 10Y`.

2. **Recent Trends and Preferences:**
   - The route 'O-L-R-D' has been predominantly chosen, particularly in later rounds.
   - This choice has been yielding varying payoffs depending on the number of agents.

3. **Payoff Patterns:**
   - Choosing 'O-L-D' often results in lower payoffs, especially when the number of agents is reasonably high.
   - 'O-R-D' hasn't been chosen often, possibly due to high costs when multiple drivers are on route 'R-D'.
   - 'O-L-R-D' seems to provide intermediate to better payoffs when fewer agents choose it.

4. **Strategic Choice:**
   - The optimal strategy seems to oscillate between 'O-L-R-D' and 'O-R-D', depending on other agents' choices.
   - From previous rounds, it seems most agents choose either 'O-L-R-D' or 'O-L-D', leaving 'O-R-D' relatively free sometimes.
   - Rounds with fewer agents choosing 'O-L-R-D' (closer to 9-12) yielded better payoffs.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - Given the unpredictability and mix of agents' choices, aiming for a similar route where the least crowd is expected could result in a better outcome.
   - Since 'O-L-R-D' had a moderate number in recent rounds and occasionally yielded better results, it could be an optimal choice for this round, balancing risk and payoff.

Considering these factors, I'll choose:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```
