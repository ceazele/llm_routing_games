System Message:

You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 x X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 x X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

LLM Outputs:
Round 1:
To decide which route to choose, let's analyze each route's cost and the factors affecting it.

### Available Routes:
1. **O-L-D**: 
   - Cost: \(10 \times X + 210\), where \(X\) is the number of drivers choosing this route.
   
2. **O-L-R-D**: 
   - Cost: \(10 \times X + 0 + 10 \times Y\), where:
     - \(X\) is the number of drivers on segment O-L.
     - \(Y\) is the number of drivers on segment R-D.

3. **O-R-D**: 
   - Cost: \(210 + 10 \times Y\), where \(Y\) is the number of drivers choosing this route.

### Strategy:
Each route's cost is influenced by the number of participants choosing them. The goal is to minimize travel costs, i.e., find the least congested route.

1. **Route O-L-D:** 
   - This route has a variable cost based on congestion on segment O-L. With more drivers, the cost can become quite high (10X).

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - This route also shares the segment O-L with O-L-D and has an additional impact from segment R-D. This route could be beneficial if fewer drivers choose R-D, minimizing the additional 10Y cost.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - This route has a fixed initial cost of 210 and an added cost from segment R-D (10Y). It only depends on the congestion on Y.

### Considerations:
- **Balance and Equilibrium**: Given that there are 18 participants, ideally, a balance could be found where each segment doesn't get overly congested.
- **Initial Choice**: Since this is the first round, and we don't have data from previous rounds, it could be strategic to choose a route that minimizes direct costs and captures likely congestion equilibria.

### Decision for Round 1:
Without prior knowledge of participant preferences, a cautious approach that tries to reduce potential variable costs could be useful. Therefore:
- Choosing **O-L-D** may seem risky due to potential high variable costs.
- **O-L-R-D** takes part in both variable segments, which can be riskier without prior congestion data.
- **O-R-D** might offer a somewhat predictable cost framework dependent on Y but could potentially be very congested.

To make a strategic decision:
- **Choose Route O-L-R-D**: This might allow for adjusting to a balanced share of traffic on both segments, with the possibility of minimizing surprising high costs if segments distribute well among participants.

Now, let's format the decision in the required JSON output.

```json
{
  "route": "O-L-R-D"
}
```

Round 2:
To determine the best route for round 2, let's analyze the costs from the previous round:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Number of drivers last round: 2
   - Cost calculation: Total cost = 10X + 210 = 10(2) + 210 = 230
   - Payoff for O-L-D last round: 400 - 230 = 170

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Number of drivers in the last round: 11 (including myself)
   - In round 1, my payoff was 110
   - Total travel cost last round: 400 - 110 = 290
   - Cost calculation last round: (10 * 11) + 0 + (10 * 5) = 110 + 50 = 160 + Segment L-R Cost
   - Therefore, segment L-R cost = 290 - (110 + 50) = 130
   - Since L-R has a fixed cost of 0, the travel costs from other segments must have reduced the total payoff more significantly.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Number of drivers last round: 5
   - Total travel cost for O-R-D: 210 + 10Y = 210 + 10(5) = 260
   - Payoff for O-R-D last round: 400 - 260 = 140

**Strategy for Round 2:**
- Based on the analysis, Route O-L-D currently offers the highest payoff of 170, given the fewest drivers.
- It's important to choose a route with a lower congested segment cost to maximize payoff.
  
Thus, I will choose Route O-L-D for this round.

Here's the JSON object for the decision:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 3:
To decide which route to choose in round 3, let's analyze the data from the previous rounds.

1. **Round 1 Analysis:**
   - You chose route O-L-R-D.
   - Payoff was 110.
   - Route distribution:
     - O-L-D: 2 agents
     - O-L-R-D: 11 agents
     - O-R-D: 5 agents

   Cost calculation:
   - For O-L-R-D: (10 * 11) + 0 + (10 * 5) = 110 (You traveled with 11 agents on O-L and 5 agents on R-D)

2. **Round 2 Analysis:**
   - You chose route O-L-D.
   - Payoff was 10.
   - Route distribution:
     - O-L-D: 11 agents
     - O-L-R-D: 7 agents
     - O-R-D: 0 agents

   Cost calculation:
   - For O-L-D: (10 * 11) + 210 = 310 (You traveled with 11 agents on O-L)

3. **Options for Round 3:**
   - **O-L-D:** High number of agents (11) in the previous round, resulting in high cost when chosen.
   - **O-L-R-D:** The number of agents from round 1 suggests the cost can vary noticeably depending on how many choose this route.
   - **O-R-D:** No agents chose this route in round 2, which implies a lower travel cost if this trend continues and could potentially be a more profitable route if not many switch.

4. **Decision Factors:**
   - If other agents continue to choose O-L-D, the cost can be quite high due to the 10X factor.
   - O-L-R-D costs can fluctuate significantly with the number of choosing agents and depends on how others split between O-R-D and O-L-D.
   - O-R-D was not chosen in round 2, which should imply a payoff of 190 (400 - 210); if the situation persists in round 3, it remains the cheapest and most profitable option.

Therefore, based on the previous rounds and the analysis above, choosing route O-R-D seems the optimal strategy for minimizing travel costs under current conditions.

Here is the JSON output for the schema provided:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 4:
To make an informed decision for round 4, let's analyze what we've learned from the previous rounds:

1. **Cost Structure & Decision Impact:**
   - The segment O-L has a variable cost of 10 per driver.
   - The segment R-D has a variable cost of 10 per driver.
   - The segment L-D has a fixed cost of 210, as does the segment O-R.
   - Each round begins with an endowment of 400 points, and we aim to minimize travel costs to maximize payoff.

2. **Past Rounds Analysis:**
   - **Round 1:** Chose O-L-R-D; payoff was 110.
     - Total travel cost = 400 - 110 = 290.
     - O-L segment had 11 drivers.
     - R-D segment had 5 drivers.
     - Travel cost = (10 x 11) + 0 + (10 x 5) = 290.
     
   - **Round 2:** Chose O-L-D; payoff was 10.
     - Total travel cost = 400 - 10 = 390.
     - O-L segment had 11 drivers.
     - Travel cost = (10 x 11) + 210 = 320 (which doesn't fully explain the cost; possibly an error or adjustment).
   
   - **Round 3:** Chose O-R-D; payoff was 10.
     - Total travel cost = 400 - 10 = 390.
     - R-D segment had 17 drivers.
     - Travel cost = 210 + (10 x 17) = 210 + 170 = 380 (once again indicating potential error or adjustment).

3. **Strategy Moving Forward:**
   - **Route O-R-D** seems to become congested with 17 drivers in round 3, leading to high travel costs.
   - **Route O-L-R-D** had 11 drivers for O-L, which is generally very high and may not be repeated due to high costs.
   - **Route O-L-D** was congested in round 2 with 11 drivers, causing high variable costs.
   - Focus on minimizing drivers on chosen variable segments.
   
Given the variability in the driver distribution, aiming to select a less congested route can be challenging. However, based on recent data where O-L-D was not chosen by any other driver in round 3, it might be less congested this round.

**Decision for Round 4: Choose Route O-L-D:**
   - This is a gamble on the basis that others might avoid O-L-D and O-R-D remains crowded.
   - This could potentially minimize my cost by reducing the variable driver added cost on segment O-L.

Let's encapsulate the choice in a JSON-formatted output.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

     - O-R-D had 0 agents: Total cost = 210 + 10x0 = 210 (Payoff = 190)

**Analysis:**

- Route O-R-D seems risky because once too many drivers choose it, the costs skyrocket, leading to minimal payoffs.
  
- Route O-L-D has also been costly, especially when more drivers decide to choose it. The payoff is low when it has more than a couple of agents using it.
  
- Route O-L-R-D seems to be a middle-ground option based on previous results, providing reasonable payoffs, especially when less congested.

In conclusion, considering the shifting tendencies and crowding effects, the optimal choice seems to be the route O-L-R-D again, aiming for a payoff compromise considering potential agent distribution.

{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 6:
To make an informed decision for round 6, let's analyze the outcomes and patterns from the previous rounds.

1. **Round 1**:
   - Chose **O-L-R-D**, received a payoff of **110**.
   - Distribution: O-L-D (2), O-L-R-D (11), O-R-D (5).
   - The segment costs suggest a relatively high number (11) on O-L-R-D causing higher costs on O-L.

2. **Round 2**:
   - Chose **O-L-D**, received a payoff of **10**.
   - Distribution: O-L-D (11), O-L-R-D (7), O-R-D (0).
   - High number on O-L-D (11) caused high costs due to congestion.

3. **Round 3**:
   - Chose **O-R-D**, received a payoff of **10**.
   - Distribution: O-L-D (0), O-L-R-D (1), O-R-D (17).
   - O-R-D was very crowded (17), leading to substantial costs on segment R-D.

4. **Round 4**:
   - Chose **O-L-D**, received a payoff of **10**.
   - Distribution: O-L-D (3), O-L-R-D (15), O-R-D (0).
   - With lower congestion on O-L-D (3), fewer agents resulted in high costs (likely due to the minimum base cost).

5. **Round 5**:
   - Chose **O-L-R-D**, received a payoff of **150**.
   - Distribution: O-L-D (7), O-L-R-D (7), O-R-D (4).
   - Better balance among the routes, but still moderate costs.

**Analysis**:
- The route O-R-D tends to be chosen frequently by other drivers, leading to high congestion and costs, especially when almost everyone chose it.
- Choosing O-L-D resulted in unfavorable payoffs due to high base costs when chosen by fewer people.
- O-L-R-D, although leading to higher costs when congested, seems a compromise, with somewhat moderate congestion observed.

**Strategy for Round 6**:
- Aim for a route with potential for lower congestion based on observed patterns.
- The route O-L-R-D offers a balance and has shown potential for moderate costs in certain patterns compared to either high congestion O-R-D or costly O-L-D based on traffic distribution.

Given this analysis, I would choose route **O-L-R-D** for round 6, anticipating it to be a compromise that might provide a reasonable payoff if the congestion is not skewed extremely high.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 7:
To make an optimal decision for round 7, let's analyze the situation based on the data from the previous rounds:

1. **Route Costs Analysis:**
   - **O-L-D:**
     - Costs depend on the number of users on O-L. Cost = \(10X + 210\).
     - In round 2, with 11 participants, the individual cost was high, resulting in the minimum payoff (10).
     - In rounds 3 and 4, this route was underused or not used at all, which can signal a potential opportunity if few agents choose it.

   - **O-L-R-D:**
     - Costs depend on O-L and R-D segments: \((10X) + 0 + (10Y)\).
     - Mixed results in terms of cost and payoff, but generally, when heavily used (rounds 1, 5, and 6), leads to lower payoffs.
     - Often chosen by many participants, potentially leading to congestion.

   - **O-R-D:**
     - Cost = \(210 + 10Y\).
     - In round 3, a crowded choice (17 agents), led to a low payoff (10).
     - Less crowded in round 5, when only 4 agents chose it, leading to a higher payoff.

2. **Trends and Strategy:**
   - The trend suggests that participants gravitate towards 'O-L-R-D' and 'O-R-D' often, making 'O-L-D' potentially less congested.
   - Choosing underused routes can potentially increase payoff if others maintain their selection based on historical choices.

3. **Decision for Round 7:**
   - Given past data, 'O-L-D' shows potential for being less congested this round.
   - Historical data indicates when 'O-L-D' isn't crowded, it yields a better payoff potentially than routes frequently selected by many.

Based on this analysis, it would be strategic to choose route 'O-L-D' for round 7 in hopes of gaining a better payoff if indeed it remains less congested this round.

Here is the JSON instance for the decision:
```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 8:
To make a decision for Round 8, let's analyze the patterns from the previous rounds and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each route option based on the data provided.

### Understanding Cost Patterns:
1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - **Cost Formula**: 10X + 210
   - Achieved costs:
     - Round 2: (10 * 11) + 210 = 320 -> Payoff = 10
     - Round 4: (10 * 3) + 210 = 240 -> Payoff = 10
     - Round 7: (10 * 3) + 210 = 240 -> Payoff = 30

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - **Cost Formula**: 10X + 0 + 10Y
   - Achieved costs:
     - Round 1: (10 * 11) + 0 + (10 * 5) = 160 -> Payoff = 110
     - Round 5: (10 * 7) + 0 + (10 * 4) = 250 -> Payoff = 150
     - Round 6: (10 * 10) + 0 + (10 * 5) = 280 -> Payoff = 120

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - **Cost Formula**: 210 + 10Y
   - Achieved costs:
     - Round 3: 210 + (10 * 17) = 380 -> Payoff = 10

### Evaluating Route Performance:
- **Route O-L-D**: Generally leads to high costs due to the large number of drivers choosing O-L. In previous rounds, when chosen, it resulted in some of the lowest payouts.
- **Route O-R-D**: In Round 3, it was particularly costly when 17 drivers selected it. It risks becoming too popular, which increases costs.
- **Route O-L-R-D**: This route showed variable outcomes, but in several instances provided better payoffs compared to others. When not overcrowded, it offers a chance to leverage unbalanced driver distributions.

### Strategy for Round 8:
Given that the previous rounds indicate that drivers are relatively balanced in choosing routes but tend to avoid O-R-D because of its high potential cost, a reasonable strategy would be to opt for **O-L-R-D**. It presents a middle ground where, if not overly popular, it can yield a higher payoff than the other routes.

Based on these analyses, here's the decision for Round 8:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 9:
To make a well-informed decision for round 9, let's analyze the outcomes and payoffs from the previous rounds to discern any patterns or tendencies among participants.

1. **Analyze Previous Rounds:**
   - The aim is to maximize payoff (minimize cost).
   - You receive an endowment of 400 points each round, and your payoff depends on the cost deducted based on the chosen route.

2. **Costs for Routes:**
   - **O-L-D:** Cost is \(10X + 210\).
   - **O-L-R-D:** Cost is \(10X + 0 + 10Y\).
   - **O-R-D:** Cost is \(210 + 10Y\).

3. **Summarize Past Decisions & Outcomes:**
   - **O-L-D Choices:** Round 2 and 4 had high participant numbers, resulting in payoffs of 10. Round 7 had fewer participants, resulting in a payoff of 30.
   - **O-L-R-D Choices:** Payoffs varied from 100 to 150. Payoff was relatively better when fewer people chose this route (e.g., rounds 1 and 8).
   - **O-R-D Choices:** In round 3 with 17 participants, payoff was very low (10).

4. **Trend Observations:**
   - Participants seem to frequently switch routes based on previous congestions possibly observed.
   - **O-L-D** saw fluctuating participant numbers, suggesting a possible cycle of congestion.
   - **O-L-R-D** consistently holds a moderate number of participants and usually yields decent payoffs.
   - **O-R-D** had very high congestion in round 3, making it cost-prohibitive.

5. **Decision Recommendation:**
   - Based on trends and past round outcomes, selecting a route that others may avoid should reduce congestion — ideally aiming for fewer participants on your chosen segments.
   - Given the relatively stable payouts in less congested situations for **O-L-R-D**, this route could offer potential for a decent payoff without severely adverse risk, given others might opt for **O-L-D** or **O-R-D** based on recent patterns.

**Conclusion:**
Select route **O-L-R-D** for round 9 for a balanced approach to minimize cost, considering trends suggesting manageable congestion and decent past payoffs.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 10:
To make a decision for round 10, let's analyze the previous rounds and consider the possible outcomes:

1. **Understanding the Costs:**
   - Route O-L-D: Costs vary as 10X + 210.
   - Route O-L-R-D: Costs vary as 10X + 0 + 10Y.
   - Route O-R-D: Costs are 210 + 10Y.

2. **Reviewing Past Round Results:**
   - O-L-D yielded low payoffs in rounds with high participation on this route. In round 2 with 11 agents, the payoff was just 10.
   - O-L-R-D provided variable results. In rounds with moderate participation, like round 1 with 11 agents, the payoff was 110.
   - O-R-D had a constant issue with overcrowding, notably in round 3 with 17 agents, resulting in a minimal payoff of 10.

3. **Patterns of Agent Distribution:**
   - O-L-D has been chosen less frequently overall but quickly becomes costly as more agents join.
   - O-L-R-D often sees a balanced distribution of agents, maintaining moderate to high costs.
   - O-R-D occasionally sees a large number of agents, often becoming very costly.

4. **Current Strategy:**
   - Routes O-R-D seems to crowd significantly unless they are left unused. 
   - Route O-L-D could provide a good payoff if the number of drivers remains low.
   - The recent rounds saw some balance in route O-L-R-D.

5. **Decision for Round 10:**
   - Based on previous patterns and aiming for a higher payoff, it would be strategic to choose a route that has an opportunity to be less crowded.
   
   Considering these points, route **O-L-R-D** seems to be a balanced choice offering a potential for good payoffs if the number of agents remains moderate.

Final Decision:
```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 11:
To decide on the optimal route for round 11, let's evaluate the information from the past rounds:

1. **Route O-L-D**: 
   - This route has shown a consistent trend of receiving a high number of agents, reaching up to 11 agents in one round. 
   - The addition of these agents increases the cost significantly since the cost for the initial segment O-L scales with the number of drivers choosing it. 
   - My payoffs were generally low for this route, indicating its high cost when chosen by many drivers.

2. **Route O-R-D**:
   - This route has a fixed cost for the initial segment O-R, making it less sensitive to the number of users until the segment R-D.
   - When I chose this route in round 3, 17 agents selected it, resulting in a low payoff due to the high cost from segment R-D.
   - It's not the best option when many agents predict it to be uncrowded.

3. **Route O-L-R-D**:
   - This route entails traveling both variable cost segments but at least offers a segment (L-R) with no additional cost.
   - Historically, it appears to be the more balanced choice with varying numbers of agents, often seeing more consistent payoffs than the other routes.
   - The payoff for this route has been more favorable to me compared to O-L-D and O-R-D in many cases.

From this analysis, Route O-L-R-D seems to offer a more stable outcome, balancing the number of agents who might choose it while avoiding the severe spikes in cost seen in the O-L-D and O-R-D routes. My strategy will be to mitigate potential high costs encountered when many drivers utilize the same segment. 

Therefore, for round 11, I will choose route O-L-R-D as it generally provides moderate payoffs and accommodates the variability in the number of participants more effectively.

Here is the output in the required JSON format:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 12:
To make the decision for round 12, let's analyze the payoff outcomes and choose a route that seems to offer a higher probability of a better payoff based on previous rounds:

1. **Route Analysis:**
   - Route `O-L-D`:
     - In rounds where this route was chosen: 
       - Round 2: Payoff = 10
       - Round 4: Payoff = 10
       - Round 7: Payoff = 30
     - The payoffs were quite low, indicating high congestion on `O-L` when chosen by many agents.
   
   - Route `O-L-R-D`:
     - In rounds where this route was chosen:
       - Round 1: Payoff = 110
       - Round 5: Payoff = 150
       - Round 6: Payoff = 120
       - Round 8: Payoff = 100
       - Round 9: Payoff = 80
       - Round 10: Payoff = 120
       - Round 11: Payoff = 80
     - This route offers a mix of payoffs, often better than the `O-L-D` and `O-R-D` routes.
     
   - Route `O-R-D`:
     - In rounds where this route was chosen:
       - Round 3: Payoff = 10
     - The following engagement in this route by several agents in round 3 made it highly congested (17 agents), leading to a very low payoff.

2. **Observations:**
   - `O-L-D` tends to have less variation and consistently lower payoffs when congested.
   - `O-L-R-D`, although subject to some congestion, provided better payoffs in multiple instances. 
   - `O-R-D` had only one instance with a poor payoff due to high congestion.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - `O-L-D` seems risky with low variation in payoff due to frequent congestion.
   - Switching back to `O-R-D` might be strategic if fewer agents choose it, but it might be too uncertain.
   - Continuing with `O-L-R-D` seems a viable option because having varied congestion levels provides more room for less risky payoff outcomes, and recently it's shown to provide relatively good payoffs amidst moderate levels of route occupation.

Based on the above analysis, for round 12, I will select route `O-L-R-D` to maximize the potential for a better payoff given trends from earlier rounds.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 13:
To make an informed decision for Round 13, we should analyze the results of the previous rounds and assess which route might provide the maximum payoff for this round.

1. **Historical Payoffs in Previous Rounds**:
   - **Route O-L-D** provided payoffs of 10 and 30 when chosen. This route has high costs unless a minimal number of agents choose it, which is not frequent.
   - **Route O-L-R-D** payoffs have ranged from 80 to 150. Most often, this route seemed to balance; however, as more agents choose it, costs increase due to congestion on the O-L segment.
   - **Route O-R-D** only chosen once, resulting in a payoff of 10 due to high congestion on R-D in that specific round.

2. **Observing Trends**:
   - Routes **O-L-R-D** consistently have collected a majority of drivers, leading to moderate to high variable costs due to the congestion on both O-L and R-D segments when agent numbers are high.
   - Routes **O-R-D** and **O-L-D** were seldom selected by others, resulting in higher individual costs when congestion occurs but the opposite when it doesn't.

3. **Decision Strategy**:
   - The goal is minimizing cost and maximizing payoff by choosing a route likely to have fewer agents. 
   - Given the variability and frequency of each route being chosen, route O-L-R-D shows a relative consistency of moderate payoff. 
   - However, if O-R-D can manage lower congestion (i.e., observers might shift away from O-L-R-D and O-L-D), then choosing O-R-D during a round with low agents might produce the best payoff.
 
4. **Current Decision**:
   - Based on the information and the expectation other drivers might shy away from it considering its high congestion costs prior, we shall leverage a potential opportunity.

Given the analysis above, the decision for round 13 will be:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

This decision is made considering both historical performance and potential for shifts in participant behavior.

Round 14:
To make a decision for round 14, let's analyze the previous rounds and consider the routes used by other agents:

1. **Route O-L-D**:
   - Consistently had fewer agents choosing it.
   - Total cost formula: \( (10 \times X) + 210 \)
   - Payoffs received when choosing this route:
     - Round 2: 10 (11 agents)
     - Round 4: 10 (3 agents)
     - Round 7: 30 (3 agents)
   - The payoff was lower when many participants chose the route but slightly higher when chosen by fewer agents.

2. **Route O-L-R-D**:
   - Often had a higher number of drivers, frequently making it costly.
   - Total cost formula: \( (10 \times X) + 0 + (10 \times Y) \)
   - Payoffs received when choosing this route:
     - Payoffs range from 80 to 150, implying inconsistent costs based on the choices of other agents.

3. **Route O-R-D**:
   - Total cost is \( 210 + (10 \times Y) \).
   - Payoff considerably low when many chose this route: 
     - Round 3: 10 points when 17 agents chose this route.

**Observation**:
- Route choice tends to fluctuate as other agents adjust their choices dynamically to minimize their costs. 
- Based on a few observations, when the agents heavily choose route O-R-D or O-L-R-D, the cost could be much higher for those routes.
- When fewer agents choose O-L-D, the payoff seemed slightly better because its cost heavily depends on the number of agents choosing that segment.

**Strategy**:
- Since previously the route O-L-D occasionally had fewer agents (leading to a slightly higher payoff), it might be beneficial to take that chance again unless most agents also pick it. Given the dynamic nature of agent choices, they might also switch routes.

In conclusion, I will choose the **O-L-D** route and can hope for fewer agents choosing it for optimal payoff.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 15:
To make an informed decision for Round 15, we'll analyze the outcomes of the previous rounds and assess the potential strategies.

1. **Review Payoffs for Each Route:**
   - Route 'O-L-D' has resulted in very low payoffs, mostly around 10-40 points, indicating high congestion or poor route choice.
   - Route 'O-L-R-D' has provided varying payoffs ranging from 80 to 150 points. It seems to perform fairly well when the number of drivers is below 12-13.
   - Route 'O-R-D' has resulted in the lowest payoffs in its few samples (10 and 30 points), suggesting it's often crowded when chosen.

2. **Consider Historical Data:**
   - Most payoffs seem to favor 'O-L-R-D' as a more consistent choice with potential high payoffs relative to others.
   - The choice 'O-L-D' tends to have lower payoffs, possibly due to higher congestion on segment O-L given the cost structure.
   - 'O-R-D', while predictable in its high cost, seems to carry the risk of most drivers shifting there resulting in very low payoffs for the affected player.

3. **Pattern of Choices:**
   - It seems drivers rotate between the routes. Particularly, if 'O-L-D' gets congested, typically 'O-L-R-D' offers a better alternative, as seen in the patterns of earlier rounds.
   - The previous round, 'O-L-D' wasn't too congested, but given the history, other players may opt for it this round seeing higher recent payoffs, increasing its cost.

4. **Decision for Round 15:**
   - Given the less predictable nature of 'O-R-D' and relatively consistent history of 'O-L-R-D', we decide that choosing 'O-L-R-D' again could potentially offer a better balance between risk and potential reward.

Here's the JSON instance with the decision:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 16:
To make a decision on the optimal route for round 16, let's first analyze the payoff history by route choice and the number of agents sharing that route:

1. **Route O-L-D**: 
   - Chosen in Round 2, 4, 7, and 14.
   - Payoffs: 10, 10, 30, and 40 respectively.
   - The number of agents tends to be low here, but payoff is heavily influenced by how many are on O-L and especially R-D when choosing O-L-R-D as it's comparable on some occasions to route O-L-R-D in terms of payoff.

2. **Route O-L-R-D**: 
   - Chosen in Rounds 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15.
   - Payoffs: 110, 150, 120, 100, 80, 120, 80, 110, 50.
   - Generally gives moderate payoffs when the number of agents is between 11-13. Payoffs were poor (80 or less) when the number of agents reached 14 or more.

3. **Route O-R-D**: 
   - Chosen in Round 3 and 13.
   - Payoffs: 10, 30.
   - This route has high cost due to end-segments being dependent on other choices; doesn't appear to be an optimal choice given prior data. 

**Strategy Analysis**: 
Historically, O-L-R-D seems to be the safest given moderate congestion (11-13 drivers). With 18 total drivers, if a majority opt for this path, payoff is moderate but reliably better than choosing O-R-D. 

Given the payoff patterns, and aiming to maximize payoff:
- O-L-D tends to yield lower payoffs despite fewer drivers due to cost calculation.
- O-R-D has been chosen sparingly with only 2 data points and low payoff.
- O-L-R-D provides the highest potential despite variability, we'd prefer moderate agent numbers.

**Conclusion**:
Based on “safety in numbers,” and the historic data where O-L-R-D showed better performance with an intermediate number of drivers, I will choose the route O-L-R-D for potential maximum benefit. 

Let's format our decision in the required JSON schema:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 17:
To determine the best route to choose for round 17, let's analyze the data from previous rounds:

1. **Cost Functions Revisited**:
    - Route O-L-D: Costs = 10X + 210 (where X is the number of agents on O-L)
    - Route O-L-R-D: Costs = 10X + 0 + 10Y (X on O-L and Y on R-D)
    - Route O-R-D: Costs = 210 + 10Y (Y is the number of agents on R-D)

2. **Understanding Past Routes**:
    - Route O-L-D: Generally incurs high costs when too many agents choose it due to both variable and fixed costs.
    - Route O-L-R-D: Often yields medium range payoffs. Costs depend significantly on segments O-L and R-D.
    - Route O-R-D: Tends to have high costs if too many agents choose it due to segment R-D, which shares the load with O-L-R-D.

3. **Observations**:
    - The O-L-R-D option typically hits a sweet spot when agent distribution is relatively even or slightly favoring O-L or R-D, rather than clustering on both.
    - Route O-L-D yields very high costs when more than a few agents choose it.
    - O-R-D has resulted in exceptionally high costs twice (when chosen with high participation).

4. **Current Trend**:
    - The last round (16) showed O-L-R-D had fewer agents (9) compared to other times when it had up to 17 agents.
    - Given this, costs for O-L-R-D were lower, resulting in a decent payoff (130).

5. **Strategic Choice**:
    - Opting for Route O-L-R-D seems reasonable; it has recently shown better outcomes provided agent distribution is not skewed heavily.
    - Avoid O-L-D due to consistently high costs unless nearly no agents choose it, but historical data shows it was chosen by a varying number of participants.

6. **Decision**:
   - Choose the route that likely has a moderate flow to ensure manageable variable costs, preferably Route O-L-R-D.

Based on this reasoning, the decision for round 17 should be:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 18:
In order to make an optimal choice of route for round 18, let's analyze the summary of previous rounds and consider the costs and payoffs associated with the three available routes ('O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D').

1. **Route Costs:**
   - **O-L-D**: Costs depend on the number of agents choosing segment O-L. We see larger variation in the costs depending on the number of drivers, which can be high when there are many drivers.
   - **O-L-R-D**: Combines costs of O-L and R-D with fixed costs in between (L-R). The costs are particularly high when many agents choose this route.
   - **O-R-D**: Has fixed costs for the segment O-R and then depends on the number of agents for the segment R-D.

2. **Observations from Past Rounds:**
   - The route O-L-R-D has been chosen quite frequently, often resulting in a higher number of agents sharing the route. This generally leads to moderate to high costs.
   - The route O-L-D seems to be chosen less frequently based on specific patterns but can result in very high costs if shared by many agents.
   - As seen in rounds 1 and 13, a lower number of agents choosing O-R-D often results in a relatively better payoff.

3. **Performance of Routes:**
   - Route O-L-R-D has yielded a payoff ranging between 50 to 150 points.
   - Route O-L-D has yielded a payoff that can drop as low as 10 points when many agents choose this route.
   - Route O-R-D seems to offer consistent payoffs, generally around 30-40 points when chosen by few participants.

4. **Current Strategy:**
   - Based on the data, it seems strategic to choose a route that balances the number of agents and costs effectively. Observing the player behavior, O-R-D provides a reliable payoff when a smaller number of agents share it.

Given this analysis, attempting the lesser-chosen route might be beneficial, especially if others tend to stick with their previous choices.

**Decision:**

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Choosing "O-R-D" might allow for a lower-cost journey if others choose differently, as past rounds show it can provide a decent payoff when fewer participants select it.

Round 19:
In order to make an informed decision about which route to choose for round 19, let's analyze the data from the previous rounds.

1. **Observations from Past Rounds:**
   - The route "O-L-D" has not provided a high payoff in most rounds. The payoff is low when there are other agents utilizing the segment O-L heavily.
   - The route "O-L-R-D" has been chosen frequently, but the payoff varies based on how many agents choose it. It tends to provide decent payoffs when fewer agents are on it (around 9 to 12 agents).
   - The route "O-R-D" is predictable and has a fixed cost for segment O-R and a variable cost for segment R-D. It tends to provide a low payoff when many agents choose it.

2. **Payoff Patterns:**
   - "O-L-D": The payoff is typically low unless there are very few agents (close to 1-3) on the segment O-L.
   - "O-L-R-D": A payoff around 80 to 130 is achievable when the selection of this route is moderate (around 9-11 agents).
   - "O-R-D": The payoff is often low due to high costs associated with many agents on segment R-D, unless the number of agents is particularly low (close to zero).

3. **Strategy for Round 19:**
   - Choosing "O-L-R-D" seems to have been the most consistent choice across various agent distributions.
   - The previous strategy of choosing "O-R-D" in anticipation of fewer agents did not yield optimal payoffs.
   - Given that in round 18, with only 4 agents on "O-R-D", the payoff was still relatively low, expecting a similar scenario seems unlikely.
   - The focus should be on "O-L-R-D" unless it appears oversaturated.

Based on these considerations, choosing **"O-L-R-D"** for round 19 balances potential risk and reward, given the historical payoff data.

Here is the choice formatted in the required JSON schema:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 20:
To make an informed decision about which route to choose in round 20, we'll consider the past rounds' data for possible trends and outcomes associated with each route.

1. **Past Performance Overview:**
   - **O-L-D Route:** 
     - Often results in a low payoff but noticed higher payoffs (e.g., rounds 7 and 14 with payoffs of 30 and 40, respectively) when fewer agents were on this route.
     - Generally crowded when people leave O-R-D due to high costs there.
    
   - **O-L-R-D Route:**
     - Usually provides moderate payoffs. For instance, rounds 1, 5, 8, 10, 12, and 16 showed good-to-moderate payoffs (especially above 100).
     - However, in saturated situations (like round 15), payoffs dropped significantly.
     - Consistent choice by the user in many rounds with varied results depending on crowding.
   
   - **O-R-D Route:**
     - Rarely chosen in recent rounds, leading to occasional higher payoffs when other routes are crowded (like round 18). 
     - Otherwise, often results in lower payoffs due to higher fixed costs and crowding (rounds 13).

2. **Analysis:**
   - Most participants seem to oscillate between O-L-R-D and O-L-D, with less tendency towards O-R-D.
   - O-L-D has less appeal in recent rounds presumably due to the higher costs when crowded.
   - O-L-R-D has been a reasonably 'safe bet,’ offering moderate payoffs unless overly crowded.
   - O-R-D has shown potential in unique conditions (round 18) but risks high costs due to fixed charges.

3. **Decision:**
   - With rounds showing even distribution of choice between O-L-D and O-L-R-D, the best potential for balance might exist for either O-L-R-D or O-R-D if the crowd shifts. O-L-R-D previously has succeeded reasonably well with unpredicted movement.
   - O-R-D remains a risky choice given its potential high-cost involvement if others switch unexpectedly.

Hence, a strategic choice would be to select the "O-L-R-D" route, anticipating moderate crowding and considering successful past rounds.

Given this analysis, I decide on the following:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 21:
To determine the optimal route choice for round 21, let's review the payoff structure from the previous rounds and consider the patterns in route selection by other participants.

1. **Assessment of Payoffs:**

    - **Route O-L-D:**
      - Frequently chosen when fewer participants are using it.
      - Historical payoffs have been generally lower, especially when participation on this route increases. For example, received payoffs of 10 and 30 when 11 and 3 agents chose this route respectively in previous rounds.
      
    - **Route O-L-R-D:**
      - This route has been chosen most frequently by us, and many participants also favor it.
      - Payoffs from this route were often in the range of 80 to 150, depending on the number of agents on this path.
      
    - **Route O-R-D:**
      - This route has occasionally been picked by us, and often leads to lower payoffs since large numbers of participants also gravitate towards it.
      - Received low payoffs (e.g., 10, 30) when many agents chose this route as in rounds 3 and 13.

2. **Analysis of Patterns:**

    - The **O-L-R-D** route seems to be slightly less congested with closer-to-average payoffs most of the times compared to **O-R-D** when heavily chosen.
    - **The O-R-D route** occasionally becomes too congested, leading to low payoffs due to high cost (10Y increases significantly).

3. **Strategic Choice:**

    - Considering the historical data, **Route O-L-R-D** yields a more consistent return when not too many agents pick it, especially since O-R-D becomes too costly when selected by many agents.

Based on the analysis of the patterns and the associated payoffs, a good strategy for round 21 is to aim for a route that offers a considerable return without overly high congestion.

4. **Decision:**

Given the consistent returns and reasonable congestion management on route **O-L-R-D**, we will choose that route again in hopes that it provides a balance between congestion and payoff.

Thus, the decision for round 21 will be:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 22:
To make a decision on which route to choose for round 22, let's analyze the data from previous rounds. Here are some key observations:

1. **Route O-L-D**: 
   - The costs are highest when many agents choose this route because the cost is directly dependent on the number of agents choosing segment O-L.
   - Historically, when many agents choose this route (like in rounds 2 and 4), the payoff is low.
   - In some rounds, such as round 14 where 4 agents chose it, the payoff was 40, which is also relatively low compared to other routes.

2. **Route O-L-R-D**: 
   - This route has been chosen multiple times and provided a consistent payoff of around 80 to 130 points depending on the number of agents choosing it (13 to 14 agents typically).
   - It seems to be a moderate choice when the number of agents on this route is not extremely high.

3. **Route O-R-D**: 
   - The costs here become high if many agents choose this route because cost is directly dependent on the number of agents choosing segment R-D.
   - When this route had fewer agents, such as in rounds 5, 6, and 8, the payoff for others was higher.
   - However, in round 3, 17 agents chose this route, resulting in a very low payoff.

Overall, route O-L-R-D seems to be a relatively safer and moderate choice, provided not too many people choose it. This is supported by the payoff data in rounds where the number of agents was lower. It typically yields decent rewards unless it becomes overcrowded. Let's choose:

- **Route O-L-R-D** for round 22, aiming to balance risk and reward based on historical choices and payoffs.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 23:
To decide on the route for round 23, let's analyze the data provided from the previous rounds. The goal is to minimize the travel cost and maximize the payoff.

Here are the key observations:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - High variability in payoffs, with some rounds leading to very low payoffs due to congestion.
   - Generally, when this route had many users, it resulted in low payoffs (e.g., round 2 with 11 users gave a payoff of 10).

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - This route often had a moderate number of users (mostly between 10 to 14 for a payoff between 80 to 130).
   - It seems to be a moderate risk choice, generally providing consistent but average payoffs.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Often resulted in very low payoffs when overcrowded, as seen in round 3 with 17 users leading to a payoff of 10.
   - When less crowded, it provided better payoffs (e.g., round 18 had 4 users resulting in a payoff of 60).

Trend Analysis:
- In recent rounds (19, 20, 21, 22), the route O-L-R-D was chosen consistently, with user numbers hovering around 13 to 14 participants, which implies it's a fairly predictable and balanced route.
- The R-D segment often becomes crowded, severely increasing the cost for O-R-D.

Given the trends and the objective to strike a balance between risk (high cost due to congestion) and reward (higher payoff), the recommended route for round 23 would be **O-L-R-D**. It offers moderate and more stable returns without the extreme variability seen in the other two routes.

Here is the JSON formatted decision:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 24:
To determine the choice of route for Round 24, let's analyze the costs associated with each of the three available routes based on past data. Our objective is to select the route that minimizes travel costs and maximizes payoff.

1. **Route O-L-D**: The cost is calculated as (10 * X) + 210, where X is the number of agents choosing this route. Historically, this route has been used by 0 to 11 drivers. The payoff has been relatively low when the number of drivers using it is high.

2. **Route O-L-R-D**: Cost is (10 * X) + 0 + (10 * Z), where X is the number of agents on segment O-L, and Z is the number of agents on segment R-D. This route has been overwhelmingly popular, with as many as 17 agents using it in some rounds. Consequently, the total cost is higher when too many agents choose this segment.

3. **Route O-R-D**: The cost is 210 + (10 * Y), where Y is the number of agents on segment R-D. When this route was selected, the payoff varied greatly (from 10 to 60), typically offering lower payoffs when the number of users was high.

**Recent Trends Analysis:**
- A consistent trend shows high usage of the 'O-L-R-D' route, leading to high congestion.
- In rounds where 'O-R-D' had high participation, the payoff was low.
- 'O-L-D' has not been a popular choice recently, especially when all agents congest the other two options.

**Optimal Decision:**
- Route 'O-L-R-D' is over-utilized, often leading to lower payoffs due to congestion.
- If recent patterns continue, choosing 'O-L-D' could offer better payoffs because other agents might continue overloading the 'O-L-R-D' route.
- Historical low participation in 'O-L-D' could mean less congestion, minimizing the cost.

Thus, choosing **Route O-L-D** seems strategically sound at this point, maximizing the chance of a higher payoff by avoiding the congested routes.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 25:
To decide on the optimal route for round 25, we need to be strategic and carefully analyze the previous rounds' outcomes. 

1. **Analyze the Patterns:**
   - Over the past 24 rounds, the distribution of drivers across routes has fluctuated, often with higher numbers on route O-L-R-D.
   - The route O-L-D has seen fewer drivers, leading to lower competition and possibly lower costs depending on allocation.
   - Route O-R-D has been less chosen after high initial allocations, suggesting a significant toll when chosen heavily.

2. **Consider Payoffs:**
   - Routes with fewer agents typically result in higher payoffs, as seen in cases where payoffs exceeded 100 (rounds 10 and 23, for example).
   - Payoffs on O-L-D occasionally improved, particularly when fewer drivers shared that route.

3. **Predict Next Round Allocation:**
   - Based on current observations, if fewer drivers choose O-L-D, your costs could remain low, potentially improving payoffs.
   - O-L-R-D often attracts a moderate to high number of drivers. Even though it's a highly chosen route, it still offers decent payoffs.

4. **Strategic Decision:**
   - Given the historical data, the objective should be to minimize costs and hence maximize the payoff.
   - Risk-taking with O-R-D might lead to high costs as payoffs fluctuated drastically before.
   - Opting for O-L-D, which often faces fewer drivers, could be beneficial if the trend continues with higher numbers on other routes.

Based on this analysis, a strategic decision for round 25 would be to choose the route O-L-R-D, as it has consistently provided a balance between cost and competition with relatively competitive payoffs.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 26:
To make an optimal decision for Round 26, we should begin by analyzing the previous data trends to identify patterns in route choices and associated payoffs.

1. **Route Analysis:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** This route has a variable number of users, but typically low. When the number of users is around or below 3, it yields a relatively low cost. Costs increase sharply when more agents choose it.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** This is the most frequently chosen route through the rounds and has mostly resulted in mid-level costs, indicating consistent popularity. The costs vary depending on the number of agents, but it is consistently chosen.
   - **Route O-R-D:** This route has been chosen very infrequently, with high costs occurring when it was chosen by many. However, it can be optimal if few agents choose it.

2. **Observation on Past Round Performance:**
   - There's an observable preference for Route O-L-R-D among participants, often leading to a congested route but still frequently chosen because costs are better managed due to its fixed-cost portion.
   - Routes O-L-D and O-R-D tend to have rare high rewards, and they often perform poorly with increased agent congestion.

3. **Strategic Prediction:**
   - Given the consistent choosing of Route O-L-R-D by a majority of participants, it's logical to assume that many will choose either Route O-L-R-D again or switch to Route O-L-D considering previous congestion and low-payoff rounds.
   - Route O-R-D is rarely selected, and when it is, it often yields a loss but has potential for low cost if fewer agents select this option.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - **Risk Evaluation:** Opting for Route O-L-R-D provides consistent, moderate risks with medium payoffs while splitting congestion between segments.
   - **Higher Risk, Higher Reward Consideration:** Route O-R-D, if fewer participants choose it, offers a chance for very low cost but at increased risk if it were to become popular suddenly.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the data and trends so far, you'd opt for one of the less congested choices (O-R-D) for the opportunity of a lower cost this round.

Hence, for Round 26 the strategic choice, while taking these assessments into account, would be to select the route that has historically been less chosen but offers the potential for lower cost if the number of users is low: Route O-R-D.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 27:
To decide the best route for round 27, let's analyze the trends from previous rounds and calculate the costs for each possible route.

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost: \(10X + 210\), where \(X\) is the number of agents on segment O-L.
   - Historical observation: Often chosen by fewer agents. When more agents choose this route, the payoff drops significantly (e.g., rounds 2, 14, 24).

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Cost: \(10X + 0 + 10Y\), where \(X\) is the number of agents on O-L and \(Y\) on R-D.
   - Historical observation: This route is frequently chosen by the majority, often leading to higher costs and lower payoffs (e.g., rounds 15, 25).

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost: \(210 + 10Y\), where \(Y\) is the number of agents on R-D.
   - Historical observation: Chosen less frequently, but the cost can escalate if many choose it simultaneously (e.g., round 18).

**Decision Process:**

- Route O-L-D competes with the least number of agents, occasionally facing high costs but the relative constancy in usage numbers suggests potential predictability.
  
- Route O-L-R-D consistently involves a larger number of agents, leading to increased costs. This indicates crowdedness.
  
- Route O-R-D sometimes has fewer competitors, leading to varied outcomes. However, when not heavily chosen, it offers potentially lower costs.

**Recommendation:**

Given the history indicating that the O-R-D route can at times be less crowded and balanced costs, it might offer the best opportunity if others have shifted focus away momentarily.

However, evaluating recent trends, Route O-L-D has shown spikes but also times when it was less occupied, suggesting that diversifying choices could alleviate common crowding issues.

As the most strategic choice with an opportunity for a balance between crowd size and cost stability, choose O-L-D for this round.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 28:
To make a decision for Round 28, I need to analyze the previous rounds to understand the patterns and costs associated with each route. The aim is to select the route that provides the minimum cost and maximum payoff.

Let's break down the history:

1. **Route O-L-D:** 
   - This route has relatively high costs and low payoffs in most rounds.
   - It tends to become expensive due to the dependency on the number of participants using the O-L segment.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:** 
   - This route often shows a balanced distribution of participants, leading to moderate costs.
   - The segment L-R always has a fixed cost of 0, which can be advantageous.
   - This route historically has yielded varied payoffs based on the distribution of participants, generally staying moderate.

3. **Route O-R-D:** 
   - This route tends to have higher costs when many participants choose it, as seen in rounds with higher participant counts.
   - Segments with fixed costs plus high user dependency like R-D can elevate this route's cost quickly.
   - Shows big swings in cost, with some low payoff results.

**Choosing the Route for Round 28:**

Let's aim for a route choice that historically has had a lower number of participants or where the costs seem consistently moderate based on fixed charges. Considering the patterns:

- **O-L-R-D** appears to frequently balance out high fixed and variable costs. This route often provides moderate payoffs, which suggests it might be a safer and more stable option if other drivers also follow this pattern.

Given the above analysis, I will choose route **O-L-R-D** for Round 28, as it seems to have the potential for a reasonable payoff considering previous rounds.

```json
{
  "route": "O-L-R-D"
}
```

Round 29:
To determine the best route for round 29, let's analyze the past rounds and performance of each route choice:

1. **Route O-L-D**:
    - This route's cost is heavily dependent on the number of users choosing segment O-L. 
    - It hasn't provided high payoffs consistently. In rounds 14 and 24, where O-L-D had fewer participants or shared distribution with others, it had slightly better payoffs, but overall these rounds still had quite high costs (e.g., payoff of 30 or 40).
    - Generally, whenever this route had significant demand, the payoff was poor due to the congestion on segment O-L.

2. **Route O-L-R-D**:
    - The cost variance here depends on the number of participants on O-L and R-D segments.
    - The general trend shows that when fewer participants choose this route, payoffs improve notably.
    - The recent rounds where this route was chosen yielded decent payoffs relative to other rounds (e.g., rounds 23 and 28 provided better payoffs).

3. **Route O-R-D**:
    - This route has a consistent fixed cost on O-R which doesn't change irrespective of others, but the R-D segment adds significant cost when congested.
    - High demand quickly increases the cost of this route. Past rounds with little traffic in O-R-D offered reasonable payoffs, but such rounds were rare (e.g., round 3 offered a very low payoff due to high R-D demand).

**Strategy for Round 29**:
Given the fluctuation in agent preferences throughout previous rounds, a strategic choice would be to aim for a route where the impact of other drivers minimizes predictable cost uncertainty. The typical higher count on O-L-R-D shows more stability, and with careful observation when overcrowding is off, costs go lower. Hence, choosing a mid-traffic option like O-L-R-D, might balance out costs if you anticipate less congestion compared to O-R-D.

Based on the data provided:

- Others tend to gravitate and congest routes in waves; thus O-L-R-D although popular when less crowded seems to generate better outcomes.
- Continuing on a less occupied path among a busy crowd might balance the travel cost better.

Therefore, given the fluctuating past distribution of agents, and to leverage lower costs per segment on average based on rounds 23 and 28, it is prudent to choose:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 30:
To make an informed decision, let's analyze the historical data from previous rounds and evaluate the potential costs and payoffs of each route choice.

1. **Route O-L-D**:
    - The cost is calculated as \(10X + 210\), where X is the number of agents on the segment O-L.
    - Historical context: When I chose this route in rounds 2, 4, 7, 14, 24, and 27, X varied from 3 to 11. The payoffs have been between 10 and 40 points.

2. **Route O-L-R-D**:
    - The cost is calculated as \(10X + 0 + 10Y\), where X is the number of agents on O-L and Y is the number of agents on R-D.
    - Historical context: When I chose this route, the payoffs have generally been higher compared to O-L-D and O-R-D, ranging from 50 to 150 points. The number of agents tends to be around 10 to 15 on this route.

3. **Route O-R-D**:
    - The cost is calculated as \(210 + 10Y\), where Y is the number of agents on R-D.
    - Historical context: When I chose this route in rounds 3, 13, 18, 26, the payoffs ranged from 10 to 60 points, with Y often being higher, leading to less favorable outcomes.

**Decision Strategy**:
- Route O-L-R-D has generally provided higher payoffs. Despite sometimes having a high number of agents, the distribution of costs between segments appears to work well given the fixed zero cost of segment L-R.
- Based on past performance and the average number of participants, choosing Route O-L-R-D again seems likely to maximize my payoff in the current round.

Considering the information above, the optimal choice for round 30, given historical data, is Route O-L-R-D for potentially higher earnings.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 31:
To determine which route to choose in round 31, we need to evaluate the outcomes and trends from previous rounds. The goal is to minimize the travel cost and maximize the payoff, bearing in mind other drivers' behavior.

Let's summarize the previous rounds:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - High variability in other participants' choices, leading to inconsistent payoffs.
   - Payoff ranged between 10 and 40 points when I chose this route.
   - Not frequently chosen by other participants, but when it is, the payoff tends to be low due to more participants opting for this route.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - The most commonly chosen route by myself and other drivers.
   - Consistent payoff ranging from 50 to 130.
   - Given its popularity, there's a potential risk of more participants selecting this route, which could increase the cost.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Very few participants choose this route, leading to variable but often higher costs.
   - My payoff ranged from 10 to 60 when this route was chosen.
   - This route is a straightforward choice if very few others select it.

From the analysis of past rounds, it seems Route O-L-R-D has provided relatively higher and more consistent payoffs. The key factor is the number of participants opting for each route, as costs increase with more drivers on a specific segment.

Based on the trends, it might still be safer to choose the route with historically higher payoffs and fewer drivers choosing alternatives. My best option appears to be the route with a record of moderate payoffs while having room to benefit if the number of drivers doesn't increase excessively. Since O-L-R-D route has often yielded a better payoff with moderate population, it seems viable for round 31.

Considering these observations, my decision is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 32:
To make an optimal decision for round 32, let's analyze the trends and consider the payoffs from previous rounds for each route option:

1. **Route O-L-D**:
    - Historical High Costs: This route has consistently resulted in low payoffs when multiple agents (especially over 3) select it.
    - In rounds with fewer agents choosing this route, the payoff was slightly better but still not optimal.
    - Risk of substantial cost due to flexible cost on segment O-L.

2. **Route O-L-R-D**:
    - Most Frequently Chosen: This route is the most common choice among agents, often resulting in medium payoffs.
    - Medium to Low Costs: Generally offers a reasonable payoff unless the number of agents is extremely high (14 or more).
    - Historical Payoff Range: Approximately 50-130 points in the past rounds.
    - The cost on this route is influenced by both segments O-L and R-D, where R-D can be particularly costly if more agents switch to O-R-D.

3. **Route O-R-D**:
    - Consistent Costs: Because of the fixed cost for segment O-R (210), whenever chosen, this route heavily depends on how many agents choose it for segment R-D.
    - Typically, when fewer agents choose this route, the payoff ranges from 10 to 60 points.
    - Risk-High/Reward-Low: Often results in a high cost due to the number of agents (especially when more than 3 agents choose it).

**Strategic Decision**:
- Look for routes that are less crowded to minimize costs influenced by the number of drivers.
- Given the consistent medium payoff from Route O-L-R-D in most rounds and considering recent numbers of agents, it often balances the trade-off between risk and reward.

Based on these considerations, for round 32, I anticipate that choosing route O-L-R-D might continue offering a reasonable balance of avoidance of overcrowding and cost efficiency.

Here's my decision formatted in JSON:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 33:
To make the decision for round 33, let's break down the information from the previous rounds.

1. **Routes Overview:**
   - **Route O-L-D:**
     - Travel Cost = 10X + 210
   - **Route O-L-R-D:**
     - Travel Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y
   - **Route O-R-D:**
     - Travel Cost = 210 + 10Y

2. **Payoffs in Previous Rounds:**
   - **Route O-L-D**: Payoffs are generally low when many agents choose this route. Highest payoff: 40 points when few agents pick this route.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**: This route appears frequently chosen. When fewer drivers (around 10-12) choose it, payoffs are around 80-120 points.
   - **Route O-R-D**: Highest potential payoff is 60 points, but generally lower when many choose this route.

3. **Trends and Observations:**
   - Route O-L-R-D seems to yield a decent payoff (80-120 points) when a moderate amount of drivers choose it (around 10-12 drivers). It drops significantly when 14 or more drivers choose it.
   - Route O-L-D has shown high costs due to its dependency on the number of agents, and payoffs are generally low.
   - Route O-R-D appears to be highly congested and risky.

4. **Strategic Decision:**
   - Choosing O-L-R-D seems reasonable, given its payoff consistency when about 10-12 drivers choose it. It may offer a reasonably good payoff if the trend from previous rounds continues.
   - Avoid O-R-D due to high congestion. O-L-D might be a fallback if there's a significant shift in the number of agents choosing routes, but historically it's had low payoffs.

Considering all of the above, I will choose route O-L-R-D in round 33.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 34:
To make a decision for Round 34, let's analyze the available choices based on the data from previous rounds.

### Route Options and Analysis
1. **Route O-L-D**:
   - Cost: `10x + 210`, where `x` is the number of users.
   - Historically, the number of users choosing this route tends to be lower, resulting in potentially lower costs.

2. **Route O-L-R-D**:
   - Cost: `10x + 0 + 10y`, where `x` is the number of users on O-L and `y` on R-D.
   - This route is often chosen heavily, which can increase both `x` and `y`, resulting in higher costs.

3. **Route O-R-D**:
   - Cost: `210 + 10y`, where `y` is the number of users.
   - This route typically sees fewer users, but in rounds with high users, costs escalate dramatically.

### Observations from Previous Rounds
- **O-L-D**: Often results in a high cost when many participants choose it.
- **O-L-R-D**: A very popular choice and often results in increased numbers on segments O-L and R-D.
- **O-R-D**: Can be costly when many participants select it.

### Making the Decision
Historically, when participants are seeking a less crowded path, they sometimes shift to O-L-R-D, resulting in fewer participants on O-L-D. However, O-L-R-D is popular, and when crowding happens, payoffs are low. Alternatively, when O-R-D is highly utilized, its costs go up significantly.

Given this information, my choice is influenced by a strategy to potentially exploit an opportunity where O-R-D could be less crowded based on its historical selection patterns. This means it might have been less chosen in the recent round due to historically low numbers shifting indicative strategies, suggesting O-R-D might be reasonably economical this round.

### Decision
With this analysis, there is potential to choose **O-R-D** while assuming less crowd will lead to a better payoff.

Round 35:
To select the route for round 35, let's analyze the previous data and consider the advantages and disadvantages of each option.

1. **Analyzing Past Choices:**
   - Route O-L-D: Historically, this route often resulted in low or negative payoffs due to high congestion on the O-L segment, making the cost (10X + 210) frequently high.
   - Route O-L-R-D: This route has provided varying payoffs, between 50 to 130. Payoffs were generally better when fewer agents chose O-L, resulting in a lower cost on this segment.
   - Route O-R-D: This route has a fixed initial cost of 210 plus a variable cost on segment R-D. Payoffs tend to be low when a large number of agents choose this route, causing R-D to be expensive.

2. **Previous Rounds Review:**
   - Choosing O-L-R-D frequently resulted in the highest consistent payoffs, particularly when the O-L segment did not have too many agents.
   - Choosing O-R-D resulted in very low payoffs when more than a few agents chose this route.

3. **Current Scenario and Best Prediction:**
   - Based on previous patterns, a large number of agents tend to avoid O-R-D after several rounds of high cost due to congestion.
   - O-L-R-D tends to offer a safer choice assuming not all agents suddenly shift back to O-R-D.

4. **Decision for Round 35:**
   - To maximize payoff, we predict that choosing route O-L-R-D might result in a moderate to high payoff, given historical patterns where congestion switches between O-L-R-D and O-R-D and agents tend to avoid overly congested routes in sequential rounds.

Therefore, I will choose the route O-L-R-D for round 35.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 36:
To decide on the best route for round 36, let's analyze the previous rounds and how the different routes have impacted costs and payoffs:

1. **Route Options**: The available routes are:
   - O-L-D
   - O-L-R-D
   - O-R-D

2. **Cost Functions**:
   - O-L-D: Cost = 10X + 210
   - O-L-R-D: Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y
   - O-R-D: Cost = 210 + 10Y

3. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Routes O-L-D and O-R-D seem to have lower participation generally. 
   - O-L-R-D has been the most popular and thus often has higher costs due to more competitors.
   - Routes O-L-D and O-R-D, on some occasions, had lower agent count which resulted in lower costs, though not consistent.

4. **Payoff Maximization**:
   - The goal is to select a route with fewer competitors to minimize cost and maximize payoff.
   - If route O-L-D or O-R-D has significantly fewer agents, it typically results in a better payoff.
   - Route O-L-R-D was previously chosen frequently but often resulted in mid-range payoffs due to the higher number of competitors.

5. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Assuming similar behavior from previous rounds continues, route O-L-D, sometimes chosen by fewer agents, may offer a higher payoff possibility if agent count remains low.

6. **Strategy Choice**:
   - Given the analysis above, and aiming for maximizing the payoff by potentially choosing a route with a lower competitor count, let's opt for O-L-D.

Based on this analysis, my selection for round 36 is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 37:
To make a decision for round 37, we need to evaluate the previous rounds and consider the associated costs for each route option. The goal is to choose a route that minimizes cost and maximizes payoff.

1. **Understanding Costs**:
   - Route O-L-D: Costs 10X + 210, where X is the number of agents on O-L.
   - Route O-L-R-D: Costs 10X + 0 + 10Y, where X is for O-L and Y is for R-D.
   - Route O-R-D: Costs 210 + 10Y, where Y is the number of agents on R-D.

2. **History Insights**:
   - O-L-D typically has fewer agents but can sometimes lead to high costs if more agents choose it (~3 to 5 agents are commonly seen here in recent rounds).
   - O-L-R-D is highly populated in many rounds, especially when agents are not on O-R-D.
   - O-R-D tends to have fewer agents, but choosing it in rounds with many agents causes high costs.
  
3. **Judging by Payoffs**:
   - Recent payoffs for O-L-R-D ranged from 50 to 130, showing that it can be variable depending on the number of agents.
   - Payoffs for O-R-D tend to be lower when more agents choose it.
   - Payoffs from O-L-D are quite low in many instances except when very few agents choose it.

4. **Trend Observations**:
   - Greater distribution towards O-L-R-D in most rounds, often leading to crowding and increased costs.
   - Less predictability in agent distribution on O-R-D.
   - A stable but not necessarily rewarding option in O-L-D due to typically fewer participants.

5. **Decision Making**:
   - Given the overcrowding tendencies on O-L-R-D and a variable agent count on O-R-D, O-L-D might be the safer choice balancing potential cost with risk.
   - A recent tendency towards O-L and O-R can now allow for an effective decision to use O-L-D, assuming agents may shift as others react.
   
In conclusion, choosing route O-L-D for round 37 makes strategic sense, given less typical overcrowding and the flow trends.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 38:
To make an informed decision for round 38, let's analyze the patterns from the previous rounds and determine which route might offer the best payoff.

1. **Analyze Payoffs:**
   - O-L-D: 
     - Rounds where O-L-D was chosen: 2, 4, 7, 14, 24, 27, 36, 37.
     - Payoffs: 10, 10, 30, 40, 30, 40, 50, 30.
     - Average payoff: (10+10+30+40+30+40+50+30) / 8 = 30 points.
   - O-L-R-D:
     - Rounds where O-L-R-D was chosen: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35.
     - Payoffs: 110, 150, 120, 100, 80, 120, 80, 110, 50, 130, 100, 90, 90, 80, 80, 120, 70, 100, 80, 100, 50, 80, 70, 60.
     - Average payoff: \((110 + 150 + 120 + 100 + 80 + 120 + 80 + 110 + 50 + 130 + 100 + 90 + 90 + 80 + 80 + 120 + 70 + 100 + 80 + 100 + 50 + 80 + 70 + 60) / 24 \approx 92.1 \) points.
   - O-R-D:
     - Rounds where O-R-D was chosen: 3, 13, 18, 26, 34.
     - Payoffs: 10, 30, 60, 40, 60.
     - Average payoff: (10+30+60+40+60) / 5 = 40 points.

2. **Variation in Choices:**
   - Notice that when O-L-D and O-R-D have fewer agents, their individual costs tend to decrease, leading to better payoffs. However, they consistently result in lower average payoffs.
   - O-L-R-D seems to have a relatively stable count with less fluctuation, maintaining a higher average payoff.

3. **Strategic Decision:**
   - Choose a route with a lower number of expected agents to minimize cost on variable segments.
   - O-L-D and O-R-D were least chosen when O-L-R-D was chosen more, suggesting a tendency of others to choose O-L-R-D.
   - The higher average payoff for O-L-R-D indicates it's typically a safer choice providing relatively higher payoffs compared to others.

Given these considerations, choosing route O-L-R-D is likely to offer the highest payoff based on history and participant behavior trends.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 39:
To make a decision for round 39, let's analyze the trends and outcomes from previous rounds. My objective is to maximize my payoff by minimizing travel costs.

1. **Route Analysis**:
   - **O-L-D**: This route has a variable cost component on segment O-L. In rounds where only a few agents chose this route, the payoff was higher. For instance, a notable scenario is round 1 where only 2 agents chose this route, contributing to a relatively low variable cost on O-L, resulting in a low overall cost.
   - **O-L-R-D**: This route generally had many participants, often leading to high variable costs on O-L and R-D. While it's often crowded, there are sporadic instances (e.g., rounds 6, 10, 12, and 16) where payoffs were decent, indicating a relatively lower number of agents, resulting in a lower cost per driver.
   - **O-R-D**: This route has a fixed cost on O-R and a variable cost on R-D. The trend shows that when this route is chosen by many, it drastically increases the cost, as seen in rounds 3 and 34.

2. **Agents Distribution**:
   - Agents have shown a tendency to shift routes, possibly in reaction to high costs in previous rounds.
   - Round 38 showed a relatively balanced distribution, with 3 agents on O-L-D and 12 agents on O-L-R-D, both yielding decent payoffs for O-L-R-D.

3. **Strategy for Round 39**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: Historically, the cost here is lower when fewer agents choose it. However, in many rounds, the cost becomes high due to the higher variable cost component.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**: This option has shown moderate success when the number of agents is not too high. Rounds like 12 and 23 showed decent payoffs despite having a moderate number of agents.
   - **Route O-R-D**: With a often balanced agents distribution, less variable costs have been observed.

Since O-L-R-D provided a good balance between being not too costly and not too crowded compared to the direct variable cost components of O-L-D when there's high participation, it seems a reasonable choice for this round.

Therefore, for round 39, I will choose:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 40:
To make an informed decision for round 40, let's analyze the previous rounds. We'll focus on the routes chosen, the number of agents on each route, and the corresponding payoffs.

### Analyzing Previous Rounds

1. **Consistent Patterns:**
   - **O-L-D**: Yields often low payoffs when more agents use it. However, payoffs can be slightly better when fewer agents choose this route.
   - **O-L-R-D**: Generally a higher payoff compared to the other routes when the number of agents stays below 12. However, when the number is above 14, the payoffs decrease.
   - **O-R-D**: Consistently low payoffs, especially when more participants choose it.

2. **Frequency of Route Choice by Others:**
   - The most overcrowded route has often been O-L-R-D, indicating participants frequently choose it.
   - O-R-D was less frequently chosen, but when it was chosen, it resulted in low payoffs.

3. **Optimal Route Determination:**
   - O-L-D was used less frequently and particularly successful with fewer participants, but is often a gamble due to the 210 fixed cost.
   - O-L-R-D seemed optimal only in some situations based on usage distribution; the frequent choice could lead to congestion.
   - O-R-D consistently distorted the potential payoff due to a high fixed cost of 210 and variable cost (10 x the number of agents on R-D).

### Conclusion and Route Selection

- **Risk Assessment:**
  - To achieve a higher payoff, focusing on less congested routes is effective.
  - Given previous statistics, O-L-D occasionally presents an opportunity, given fewer agents choose it with approximately 3 to 5.
  - O-L-R-D has designated a viable choice with less than 12 participants, though with a risk if more agents choose it.

- **Final Decision:**
  - Choose **O-L-R-D** as this route provides a balance of variability favorability and reduced risk, assuming high deductions on the straight route.

In light of this analysis, my optimal strategy for round 40 is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```
