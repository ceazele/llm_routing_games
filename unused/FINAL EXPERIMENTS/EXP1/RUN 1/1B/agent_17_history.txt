System Message:

You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 x X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 x X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

LLM Outputs:
Round 1:
To make a strategic decision in this traffic network game, let's analyze each route based on the given information.

1. **Route Options and Their Costs**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: Total cost = 10X + 210, where X is the number of drivers choosing this route.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**: Total cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y, where X is the number on O-L and Y is the number on R-D.
   - **Route O-R-D**: Total cost = 210 + 10Y, where Y is the number of drivers choosing this route.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Route O-L-D has variable costs due to congestion on segment O-L. So, if many drivers choose this route, the cost increases significantly.
   - Route O-L-R-D also has congestion costs on segment O-L initially, and then on R-D. It has some potential to balance costs if O-L is less congested than R-D.
   - Route O-R-D has a fixed initial cost, with the only variable portion being segment R-D. Choosing this might be beneficial if we expect fewer drivers to choose R-D.

3. **Strategy**:
   - In the first round, we have no prior data on other participants' behavior. Thus, a balanced choice with less initial congestion can be a reasonable start.
   - Route O-R-D offers a fixed cost initially, which is predictable. The additional cost on segment R-D depends on the number of users, which is definitely a risk but potentially less than others if many participants jump to O-L initially.

After evaluating all considerations, I'll choose the route that seems to have a good balance of predictability and potential cost:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

This route allows for an initial known cost with a risk factor only at the end, which might be strategic in an initial round where patterns are yet to be established.

Round 2:
To make a decision for round 2, let's analyze the situation from round 1 and consider the cost structure:

1. **Routes and Costs:**
   - **O-L-D:** Cost = \(10X + 210\)
   - **O-L-R-D:** Cost = \(10X + 0 + 10Y\)
   - **O-R-D:** Cost = \(210 + 10Y\)

2. **Round 1 Summary:**
   - I chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 30.
   - This means my travel cost was \(400 - 30 = 370\).
   - Number of agents on each route:
     - O-L-D: 2 agents
     - O-L-R-D: 11 agents
     - O-R-D: 5 agents (including myself).

3. **Calculating Costs for Round 1:**
   - **O-L-D:** Travel cost per agent = \(10 \times 4 + 210 = 250\) (not chosen by me)
   - **O-L-R-D:** Travel cost per agent = \(10 \times 13 + 10 \times 5 = 180\) (not chosen by me)
   - **O-R-D:** Travel cost per agent = \(210 + 10 \times 5 = 260\)

4. **Choosing the Optimal Route for Round 2:**
   - The least crowded route in round 1 was O-L-D (2 agents), leading to the least shared segment cost.
   - The O-L-D route may offer lower costs if fewer agents choose it again.

5. **Strategy for Round 2:**
   - Choosing O-L-D may be beneficial if it remains less crowded. This route's variable costs can potentially be the lowest due to fewer agents dividing the cost.

Based on the analysis above, my choice for round 2 will be:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 3:
To decide which route to choose in round 3, we need to analyze the previous rounds and consider how to maximize our payoff by minimizing travel costs. Let's evaluate the options:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - This route's cost is determined by \( (10 \times X) + 210 \), where \( X \) is the number of agents on segment O-L.
   - In round 1, 2 agents chose this route. The travel cost would have been \( (10 \times 2) + 210 = 230 \).
   - In round 2, 11 agents chose this route. The travel cost was \( (10 \times 11) + 210 = 320 \), and we received a payoff of 10.
   
2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - This route's cost is determined by \( (10 \times X) + 0 + (10 \times Y) \), where \( X \) is the number of agents on segment O-L, and \( Y \) is the number of agents on segment R-D.
   - In round 1, 11 agents chose this route. The calculated cost would have been \( (10 \times 11) + 0 + (10 \times 5) = 210 \). However, this value is not aligned with any specific payoff mentioned in the results.
   - In round 2, 7 agents chose this route. The cost would have been \( (10 \times 7) + 0 = 70 \) for the segment and \( 10 \times Y \) to be calculated depending on the R-D segment.
   
3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - This route's cost is a constant 210 plus \( (10 \times Y) \) where \( Y \) is the number of agents on segment R-D.
   - In round 1, we chose this route, and 5 agents selected it. The cost was 210 plus \( (10 \times 5) = 50 \), for a total of 260, which left us with a payoff of 30.
   - In round 2, no agents chose this route, so the potential cost would be 210, with a maximum payoff of 190.

Now, considering past rounds:
- Route O-R-D offers a payoff when fewer agents are on it.
- Route O-L-D had a higher number of agents in round 2, leading to a lower payoff.
- Route O-L-R-D has variable costs depending on the R-D segment, with fewer agents moving toward it.

For round 3, a reasonable strategy could be to choose Route O-R-D. Given that no agents chose it in round 2, if we select it alone, this results in a cost of 210 and a payoff of 190. This is potentially the most profitable choice if the pattern holds.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 4:
To decide on the best route for round 4, let's analyze the previous rounds and consider potential outcomes.

### Analysis of Previous Rounds:

#### Round 1:
- **Your Choice**: O-R-D
- **Payoff**: 30
- **Distribution**: 
  - O-L-D: 2 agents
  - O-L-R-D: 11 agents
  - O-R-D: 5 agents

#### Round 2:
- **Your Choice**: O-L-D
- **Payoff**: 10
- **Distribution**:
  - O-L-D: 11 agents
  - O-L-R-D: 7 agents
  - O-R-D: 0 agents

#### Round 3:
- **Your Choice**: O-R-D
- **Payoff**: 10
- **Distribution**:
  - O-L-D: 0 agents
  - O-L-R-D: 1 agent
  - O-R-D: 17 agents

### Observations:
- **Route O-L-R-D** is not a popular choice but can be beneficial if few agents choose it due to the zero cost for the segment L-R. However, it was heavily chosen in Round 1.
- **Route O-R-D**, which has fixed costs on O-R, was the most chosen route in Round 3, leading to high costs due to 17 agents choosing it.
- **Route O-L-D** showed high cost in Round 2 due to 11 agents choosing it.

### Strategic Considerations for Round 4:
- **Route O-R-D** could potentially have fewer agents if others switch due to high costs previously. However, it is unpredictable based on high usage before.
- **Route O-L-D** might see a decrease in agents if others are deterred by the high costs they experienced before.
- **Route O-L-R-D** could be a safer middle ground if it doesn't attract too many agents, with only 1 agent in the last round.

Given the uncertainty, but observing that each route can potentially be less congested at different times, a plausible strategy would be to pick the less chosen but potentially beneficial route if congestion is low.

### Decision:
To maximize the potential for a higher payoff, selecting the route that was least used in the last round might offer the opportunity for lower congestion costs. In Round 3, O-L-D had 0 agents, which may imply potential low congestion if others are deterred by prior high costs. However, O-L-R-D had only 1 agent, with a fixed 0 cost on segment L-R.

Thus, I will choose **route O-L-R-D** considering its low recent usage and the potential for low overall cost.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 5:
To determine the best choice for round 5, we need to analyze the costs and payoffs associated with each route based on past rounds.

### Recap of Route Characteristics
1. **O-L-D**: 
   - Cost = 10X + 210 (X = number of participants on O-L)
2. **O-L-R-D**: 
   - Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y (X = number on O-L, Y = number on R-D)
3. **O-R-D**: 
   - Cost = 210 + 10Y (Y = number on R-D)

### Analysis of Previous Rounds

- **Round 1**:
  - You chose O-R-D, total drivers = 5. 
  - Cost = 210 + (10*5) = 260, Payoff = 400 - 260 = 140
  
- **Round 2**:
  - You chose O-L-D, total drivers = 11.
  - Cost = (10*11) + 210 = 320, Payoff = 400 - 320 = 80

- **Round 3**:
  - You chose O-R-D, total drivers = 17.
  - Cost = 210 + (10*17) = 380, Payoff = 400 - 380 = 20
  
- **Round 4**:
  - You chose O-L-R-D, total on O-L = 18, R-D = 15.
  - Cost = (10*18) + 0 + (10*15) = 330, Payoff = 400 - 330 = 70

### Strategy for Round 5

To make a decision for round 5, we need to consider:
1. The least popular route tends to have a lower cost because fewer participants on variable-cost segments reduce the additional multiplier cost.
2. Based on previous rounds, O-L-D was less populated in round 3, O-L-R-D had fewer participants in round 2 and O-R-D fluctuates.
  
Given round 4 had everyone on O-L, making it highly costly and less efficient, opting for the currently least used path historically post round reset would be wise. Observing round 3, O-L-D was not used at all.

### Decision for Round 5

Choose route **O-R-D** because:
- Historically it seems to have fluctuation and might again be underused after participants alternate based on past heavy penalties when crowded.
- Its fixed segment cost can be advantageous over highly variable-use dependent costs evident in some rounds.

Based on this strategy, the JSON-formatted decision for round 5 is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 6:
To make an informed decision for round 6, we need to analyze the previous rounds' outcomes and aim to maximize the payoff by selecting a route that minimizes travel cost. 

1. **Understand the Costs:**
    - **Route O-L-D:** Cost = 10X + 210
    - **Route O-L-R-D:** Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y
    - **Route O-R-D:** Cost = 210 + 10Y

2. **Review Previous Rounds:**
    - **Round 1:** You chose O-R-D; payoff was 30 (high number on O-L-R-D).
    - **Round 2:** You chose O-L-D; payoff was 10 (high number on O-L-D).
    - **Round 3:** You chose O-R-D; payoff was 10 (all chose O-R-D).
    - **Round 4:** You chose O-L-R-D; payoff was 70 (majority chose O-L-R-D).
    - **Round 5:** You chose O-R-D; payoff was 80 (balanced numbers, fewer on O-R-D).

3. **Observations:**
    - **O-R-D** typically incurs higher costs when it is heavily chosen (as in Round 3 with 17 agents).
    - **O-L-D** tends to have high costs when heavily chosen (as in Round 2 with 11 agents).
    - **O-L-R-D** balanced costs but not lucrative if many choose it (as seen in round 4).

4. **Analysis for Round 6:**
    - The optimal strategy is often to choose a less popular route to avoid shared congestion costs.
    - If the previous pattern of alternating and balancing agent distribution continues, routes like **O-R-D** might generally be less crowded in the next round, based on the alternating pattern from previous rounds.

5. **Decision for Round 6:**
   - Considering recent patterns, choosing a route that might see less congestion is strategic. Based on round 5, multiple drivers picked O-L-D and O-L-R-D evenly, and fewer chose O-R-D. It's logical to continue with **O-R-D** to benefit from lower congestion probability.

JSON Decision:
```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 7:
To determine the most optimal route for round 7, it's crucial to evaluate the previous rounds and apply strategic thinking based on observed patterns. Let's analyze and consider the options:

1. **Previous Rounds Overview:**
   - Round 1: Chose O-R-D, received a payoff of 30. (5 agents on O-R-D)
   - Round 2: Chose O-L-D, received a payoff of 10. (11 agents on O-L-D)
   - Round 3: Chose O-R-D, received a payoff of 10. (17 agents on O-R-D)
   - Round 4: Chose O-L-R-D, received a payoff of 70. (15 agents on O-L-R-D)
   - Round 5: Chose O-R-D, received a payoff of 80. (4 agents on O-R-D)
   - Round 6: Chose O-R-D, received a payoff of 40. (5 agents on O-R-D)

2. **Patterns and Observations:**
   - Route O-R-D tends to vary significantly in cost depending on the number of agents, resulting in payoffs fluctuating between 10 to 80.
   - Route O-L-D generally had higher costs with large numbers of agents choosing it in round 2, leading to a payoff of only 10.
   - Route O-L-R-D achieved a decent payoff of 70 when chosen in round 4, but with a high number of 15 agents, which reduces its current attractiveness if others might choose it.

3. **Current Consideration:**
   - Route O-R-D had fewer travelers in round 5, resulting in the highest payoff of 80. It remains a potentially optimal choice, provided that not many agents choose it.
   - The decision to choose O-R-D in round 5 based on its lower occupancy appears wise. Picking it again could leverage similar strategic advantage if others avoid it.

Given these observations, it's favorable to choose the route O-R-D again with the hope that a lower number of agents will select it, similar to the pattern seen in round 5. By choosing O-R-D, there is potential for a high payoff if few competitors choose it.

Therefore, I will select the route O-R-D for round 7. Here is the JSON output for the decision:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 8:
To decide on the optimal route for Round 8, let's analyze the results and payoffs of previous rounds and consider the potential strategies:

1. **Round Analysis**:
   - **O-R-D**: 
     - In several rounds (1, 3, 5, 6, 7), the chosen route was O-R-D with varying outcomes.
     - Best payoff with O-R-D was 80 (Round 5) when only 4 agents chose this route.
     - Payoffs for O-R-D have generally been low when the number of agents on this route was high (as seen in Round 3 with only a payoff of 10).

   - **O-L-D**:
     - Chosen in Round 2 with a payoff of 10, suggesting a high number of agents (11) leads to a high cost.
     - The segment O-L is subject to congestion costs, which rise with the number of drivers.

   - **O-L-R-D**:
     - Chosen in Round 4 with a payoff of 70, despite a relatively high number of total agents (15).
     - Offers a potentially moderate payoff depending on how congested segments O-L and R-D are.
     - The fixed cost of 0 on segment L-R can help if R-D is less congested.

2. **Current Situation & Reasoning**:
   - Routes with fewer agents tend to offer higher payoffs due to lower congestion costs on variable-cost segments.
   - O-L-R-D, despite being frequently chosen (11 to 15 agents in previous rounds), offers a strategic advantage if segments O-L or R-D have high competition.
   - Current data shows fluctuating agent choices, indicating potential unpredictability in route popularity.

3. **Strategic Choice**:
   - **O-R-D** could be less appealing if it becomes too popular, increasing segment R-D’s cost substantially.
   - **O-L-R-D**, with relatively moderate past performance payoffs, offers a safer choice given its fixed cost advantage on segment L-R and potential for lower total costs if O-L is less congested.
   - Given the agent distribution pattern of previous rounds (high initial selection for O-L-D followed by shifts), there's a notable chance competitors might avoid overused routes.

Considering the above analysis, the strategic move for Round 8 would be:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 9:
To decide on the best route for Round 9, let's analyze the information from the previous rounds step-by-step:

1. **Understanding Cost Structures:**
   - **O-L-D:** Cost = `10 * X + 210` where X is the number of agents on O-L.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Cost = `10 * X + 0 + 10 * Y` where X is the number of agents on O-L and Y is the number on R-D.
   - **O-R-D:** Cost = `210 + 10 * Y` where Y is the number of agents on R-D.

2. **Analyzing Previous Rounds:**
   - In most rounds where few agents chose O-R-D, the payoff was higher (Round 5: Payoff 80, Round 7: Payoff 40).
   - O-L-R-D provided the best payoff when the number of agents on that route was moderate compared to others (Round 8: Payoff 100).
   - O-L-D mostly resulted in low payoffs unless significantly fewer agents chose it (Round 2: Payoff 10, Round 4: Payoff 70).

3. **Population Dynamics:**
   - The balancing of agents across routes seems to affect payoffs significantly.
   - Avoiding routes with large concentrations of agents on segments L-D and R-D seems favorable.

4. **Strategic Consideration:**
   - To maximize payoff, choosing a route that is likely to have fewer competing agents is ideal.
   - Historically, when fewer have chosen O-R-D, payoffs have been relatively high.
  
Given these observations, O-L-R-D seems the best option, provided it is not crowded with agents. In recent rounds, it's been less populated compared to others, and I'm aiming for fewer than ten drivers on O-L-R-D to ensure a good payoff.

Therefore, for Round 9, I choose the route O-L-R-D.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 10:
To decide which route to choose in round 10, let's analyze the previous rounds' outcomes and try to anticipate the behavior of other drivers:

1. **Observation of Costs and Payoffs:**
   - **Route O-R-D:** 
     - In round 3, with 17 drivers, the payoff was low (10 points), indicating high congestion.
     - In rounds 5, 6, and 7, the number of drivers was 4, 5, and 2 respectively, allowing payoffs of 80, 40, and 40. This suggests that when fewer drivers choose this route, the payoff improves.
   
   - **Route O-L-D:** 
     - In rounds 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7, there were 2, 11, 3, 3, and 3 drivers on this route, with varying results. Most notably, during round 2, when 11 drivers chose it, the payoff was very low (10 points).
   
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** 
     - This route has also seen high traffic in rounds 1, 4, 8, and 9, with a decent payoff only in cases where fewer drivers chose other routes.
     - Payoffs varied significantly in this route, with a couple of lower congestions (rounds 4 and 9) giving payoffs like 70 and 80.

2. **Patterns and Considerations:**
   - It seems the route **O-R-D** is a good choice if the number of other drivers choosing it remains low, allowing for high payoffs, which happened in rounds 5, 6, and 7 when you scored 80 and 40.
   - **Route O-L-R-D** seems risky as it often gets congested, causing variability in payoffs.
   - **Route O-L-D**, while often used by fewer drivers, tends to attract too many drivers at times, reducing the payoff.

3. **Anticipating Other Drivers:**
   - In rounds where you received good payoffs (rounds 5 and 8), more drivers leaned towards routes O-L-R-D in general, leaving O-R-D less crowded.
   - Given the behavior from the previous rounds, it may be plausible that drivers will try to avoid overly congested routes.

4. **Decision for Round 10:**
   - Based on the observations, the route **O-R-D** has the potential of offering a good return if it remains moderately unchosen by others. Given its history, it's less likely for it to reach full congestion like in round 3 very frequently.
   - Choosing **O-R-D** is a gamble on fewer drivers making the same choice. Still, it seems the most favorable in terms of consistent value when not crowded.

Here is the JSON decision based on the above analysis:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 11:
To maximize the payoff, we must minimize the cost and choose the route wisely based on past data and current trends. Let's analyze the outcomes from previous rounds and observe trends:

1. Route O-L-D: 
   - Costs: 
     - Segments: 10X (O-L) + 210 (L-D)
   - Previous trends:
     - Often chosen by fewer drivers compared to O-L-R-D, hinting potentially lower segment congestion.
     - In rounds 2 and 5, more agents chose O-L-D, resulting in less favorable payoffs.

2. Route O-L-R-D:
   - Costs: 
     - Segments: 10X (O-L) + 0 (L-R) + 10Y (R-D)
   - Previous trends:
     - Frequently the most chosen route, indicating a high congestion probability.
     - In round 4, it provided a reasonably good payoff perhaps because more participants avoided O-R-D.

3. Route O-R-D:
   - Costs:
     - Segments: 210 (O-R) + 10Y (R-D)
   - Previous trends:
     - Variable trends in selection.
     - In rounds when fewer drivers chose this route, better payoffs resulted due to a less congested segment R-D.

## Summary of each round's outcomes:

- Route O-R-D was less congested in rounds: 5, 6, 7 (providing better payoffs).
- Routes O-L-D and O-L-R-D were more viable when fewer people chose O-R-D, creating distinction in costs.

Given these patterns and outcomes of previous rounds:
- O-R-D is likely to provide a decent payoff if a moderate number choose it, particularly if other routes experience greater congestion.
- O-L-R-D could potentially be advantageous if O-L segment congestion isn't extreme, and this route's middle segment cost is stable.

Given the information from the previous rounds, choosing route **O-R-D** seems potentially beneficial if we predict less congestion on segment R-D. Route decisions should be revisited if many agents shift strategies currently.

Hence, the decision for round 11 is:
```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 12:
To determine the best route for round 12, we'll analyze the data from previous rounds and assess the potential traffic distribution. Our aim is to identify a route that could yield a high payoff by minimizing travel costs. Let's analyze step-by-step:

1. **Past Payoffs and Route Choices:**
   - The highest payoff from previous rounds was 100 when choosing route O-L-R-D (round 8), indicating low congestion on R-D.
   - The second highest payoff was 80, again for route O-R-D (round 5), showing a balance between congestion and cost in R-D.
   
2. **Congestion Patterns:**
   - Route O-R-D has varied in terms of agent count, but low agent counts do tend to yield higher payoffs (e.g., Rounds 10 and 11 with 3 agents gave a good payoff).
   - Route O-L-R-D tends to have more agents on it, but occasionally gives a good payoff (e.g., round 8).
   
3. **Predicting Agent Distribution:**
   - Historically, there's a fluctuation in agent distribution, but routes O-R-D and O-L-R-D often have fewer agents than O-L-D.
   - Agents seem to frequently choose O-L-R-D; however, when traffic on O-L-D decreases, it increases the attractiveness of O-R-D and O-L-R-D.
   
4. **Strategy:**
   - Given the variable congestion on segment R-D, if we choose O-R-D, we risk congestion on R-D but benefit from the fixed low cost on O-R.
   - O-L-R-D offers a lower cost segment L-R but can be congested on both L-R and R-D.
   
5. **Best Choice:**
   - Route O-R-D has shown near or equal results to the best payoffs and may have a slightly less predictable congestion pattern, which can work in our favor if others move to O-L.

Based on this analysis and aiming for a potential high payoff, I will choose route O-R-D for round 12, hoping to encounter a favorable agent distribution. Here is the JSON route selection:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 13:
To make a decision for round 13, let's analyze the past rounds and identify any patterns or insights that might help us choose the optimal route to maximize our payoff.

### Analysis of Past Rounds:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Historically, this route has been chosen less frequently by the majority.
   - Previous payoffs have been mixed (Round 2: 10 payoff, but that was with 11 agents on the same route).

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Has been frequently chosen by a larger number of agents, making it often congested.
   - Payoffs have generally been moderate to high when the number of users is on the lower side (Round 8: 100 payoff with 12 agents).

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - High variability in payoff based on the number of agents.
   - Historically, when fewer agents are on this route, higher payoffs are observed (Round 5: 80 payoff with 4 agents).

### Key Observations:

- **Recent Trends:** The route O-L-R-D has been the most consistently congested, followed by O-R-D.
- **Optimal Decisions Depend on Agent's Distribution:** Gains depend significantly on other agents' choices. 

### Strategy for Round 13:

Given the provided data and trends:
- Choosing a less crowded route should maximize payoff.
- The least used routes recently have been O-R-D and O-L-D.
- With the least drivers historically opting for O-L-D, there's potential if others keep avoiding it.

Despite the variability, choosing route O-L-R-D might be productive if we assume fewer agents will opt for it this time, given prior congestion. But due to the risk involved with congestion on O-L-R-D based on previous data, *O-R-D* is a safer gamble if we continue the trend rather than break it.

Thus, opting for **Route O-R-D** seems like a balanced strategy for round 13, leveraging insights from previous patterns.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 14:
To make a decision on which route to choose for Round 14, let’s analyze the past data to identify any patterns or strategies:

1. **Cost Analysis for Each Route:**
   - **O-L-D:** The cost for this route is 10X + 210, where X is the number of agents on O-L. This route has been moderately chosen in the past, but when heavily chosen, it resulted in low payoffs (e.g., Round 2).
   - **O-L-R-D:** The cost for this route is 10X + 0 + 10Y, where X is the number of agents on O-L and Y is the number on R-D. This route generally costs less when fewer agents choose it. Previously, it provided some high payoffs (e.g., Rounds 4 and 8).
   - **O-R-D:** This route’s cost is 210 + 10Y, where Y is the number on R-D. It benefited when fewer agents took it (e.g., Rounds 5 and 10), but became costly with more agents (e.g., Round 3).

2. **Historical Patterns:**
   - Routes with fewer agents tend to result in higher payoffs due to lower congestion costs.
   - **O-R-D** provided good payoffs when a small number of agents (3-5) chose it.
   - **O-L-R-D** provided good payoffs when it wasn’t the most popular choice.

3. **Round 14 Strategy:**
   - **O-R-D** has been the most beneficial when the number of agents on it is low. However, it has also been a fallback for others, creating competition.
   - **O-L-R-D**, although sometimes crowded, offered high payoffs when less crowded.
   - **O-L-D**, been less favorable due to high costs once congested.

Given the choices, it seems strategic to select a route that has not consistently been overly popular recently. Historically, **O-L-R-D** may provide a better opportunity if it doesn't have a significant increase in traffic, given its past performance in similar conditions.

In conclusion, for Round 14:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 15:
To make an informed decision about which route to choose in round 15, let's analyze the patterns from the previous rounds:

1. **Route Costs Analysis**:
   - **O-L-D**: Cost = 10 * (drivers on O-L) + 210
   - **O-L-R-D**: Cost = 10 * (drivers on O-L) + 0 + 10 * (drivers on R-D)
   - **O-R-D**: Cost = 210 + 10 * (drivers on R-D)

2. **Previous Round Insights**:
   - Routes O-L-R-D and O-R-D seemed to generally attract more drivers.
   - Route O-L-D was rarely chosen, possibly due to consistent high cost.

3. **Patterns for High Payoff**:
   - In rounds where you chose O-L-R-D, you received higher payoffs, especially when fewer drivers were on segments O-L and R-D (e.g., Rounds 8 and 14).
   - In rounds where O-R-D was less crowded (e.g., Round 5), you also received a relatively higher payoff.

4. **Trend Observation**:
   - When O-L-D and O-R-D have fewer drivers, they tend to offer better payoffs.
   - O-L-R-D seems to be a more stable option when predicting fewer drivers on the O-L and R-D segments.

5. **Strategic Choice for Round 15**:
   - Given the variability of other drivers' choices, and considering recent previous rounds where fewer participants were seen in rounds leading to higher payoffs, a strategic choice would be:

   **O-L-R-D** when fewer drivers are expected on the O-L and R-D segments since it has historically provided a higher payoff.

Taking these analyses into account, my choice for round 15 is to select route O-L-R-D, hoping the driver distribution remains similar or favorable as observed in high payoff rounds.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 16:
To determine the best route choice for round 16, let's analyze the previous rounds to identify any patterns and evaluate the cost associated with each route.

### Route Analysis
1. **Route O-L-D**
   - Cost function: \(10X + 210\)
   - Historically, this route has often been chosen by fewer players (around 0-11), although in round 2, 11 agents chose this route which led to a high cost.
   - Recent rounds show only a few players (1-4) choosing this route.
   - This route could be costly if many people decide to pick it.

2. **Route O-L-R-D**
   - Cost function: \(10X + 0 + 10Y\)
   - Consistently chosen by a large number of agents (ranging from 10-17), which makes it costly.
   - Payoff was higher in rounds where fewer people opted for this route.

3. **Route O-R-D**
   - Cost function: \(210 + 10Y\)
   - Also a popular choice but has resulted in a better payoff in instances where fewer players opted for it (3-5 players).

### Observations
- **Route O-L-R-D** offers the most variable results, where the payoff depends highly on the other players' choices.
- **Route O-R-D** has had decent payoffs when fewer players chose it.
- **Route O-L-D** has not been very popular in recent rounds, suggesting it might offer a lower cost if this trend continues.

### Conclusion
Given the patterns from the past rounds and to potentially minimize costs, **Route O-L-D** might be a strategic choice if I anticipate that fewer agents will choose it in round 16, keeping the cost low. However, there is always a risk of others choosing it as well, potentially increasing the cost.

Let's select **Route O-L-D** for round 16.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 17:
To decide which route to choose for round 17, let's analyze the previous rounds' data to identify any patterns and evaluate the expected payoffs for each route option based on historical choices by other agents:

1. **Route O-L-D**:
   - This route has been less popular in the recent rounds, and the number of agents choosing it has fluctuated. When fewer agents choose this route, the payoff could be higher.
   - Previous payoffs include (some of the notable ones): 10 (Round 2), 50 (Round 16).

2. **Route O-L-R-D**:
   - In rounds where O-L-R-D was chosen by many agents, the payoff was generally good. For example, in rounds where it was chosen by fewer agents, the payoff reached as high as 70 to 110.
   - Previous payoffs include (some of the notable ones): 100 (Round 8), 80 (Round 9), 110 (Round 14).

3. **Route O-R-D**:
   - This route generally incurs lower payoffs when many agents decide to choose it due to its fixed high cost combined with variable congestion cost.
   - Given that the number of agents can vary widely on this route, and that in rounds like Round 3 when chosen by many, it yielded a low payoff of 10.
   - Recent rounds had payoffs such as: 30 (Round 13), 50 (Round 12).

**Decision Strategy**:
- Route O-L-R-D seems to offer a high payoff when the number of agents stays low or moderate. However, over-utilization seems risky as seen in some rounds. 
- Route O-L-D has resulted in high payoff when fewer agents chose it, which might be strategic if you anticipate fewer users choosing this route in the next round based on patterns.
- Route O-R-D generally results in varying payoffs, often lower due to fixed costs, unless only a few agents choose it.

Considering this analysis, choosing the route O-L-R-D seems to be the most strategic if the number of agents choosing it remains around 11-12, which has historically yielded decent payoffs of around 100.

Thus, for round 17, I will choose the route O-L-R-D hoping to maintain a favorable number of agents splitting across routes.

Here is the JSON output according to the schema provided:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 18:
To decide on the best route for round 18, let's first review the outcomes and patterns observed in the previous rounds:

1. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Chosen in rounds 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13.
   - Payoffs range from 10 to 80.
   - Seems less favorable when more agents use it (e.g., high user count in round 3 leads to low payoff).

2. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Chosen in rounds 2, 16.
   - Payoffs were 10 and 50.
   - High number of people on this route generally results in lower payoff due to the variable cost.

3. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Chosen in rounds 4, 8, 9, 14, 15, 17.
   - Payoffs range from 50 to 110.
   - Consistently yields high payoffs when the number of agents choosing it remains moderate to high.

**Insights:**

- **O-R-D:** This route can lead to variable costs that escalate quickly when occupancy is high, leading to lower payoffs.
  
- **O-L-D:** Similar to O-R-D as its variable cost can also inflate with high occupancy, but a bit less volatile than O-R-D.

- **O-L-R-D:** This route has consistently given higher payoffs. It offers a balance where the R-D leg’s cost is usually shared, keeping overall costs lower.

**Strategic Choice:**

Based on observations from past rounds and strategies, choosing route **O-L-R-D** seems to be the optimal decision. It has frequently led to higher payoffs when the number of agents on other routes fluctuates. Its structure minimizes variable costs effectively, ensuring better utilization of our 400-point endowment.

Let's format this decision in the required JSON schema.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 19:
To decide on the optimal route for round 19, let's analyze the trend and pattern from the past rounds:

1. **Route O-L-D Trends**:
   - When O-L-D has more than 4 agents, the payoff is usually low. 
   - In Round 2, with 11 agents, the payoff was 10, which is very low.
   - In Rounds where you or others have chosen it with less than 5 agents, the payoffs weren't recorded indicating you may not have chosen it optimally, or it could be a mixed choice for players.

2. **Route O-L-R-D Trends**:
   - Consistently, Route O-L-R-D has resulted in relatively higher payoffs when not overcrowded.
   - For example, Rounds 8, 14, 17, and 18 had fewer agents on this route (around 12 to 9), and the payoffs were among the highest: 100, 110, 100, and 130 respectively.

3. **Route O-R-D Trends**:
   - When overcrowded, (e.g., Round 3 with 17 agents), it led to a very low payoff of 10.
   - However, when fewer agents (around 3 to 5) chose it, like in Rounds 5, 6, 7, and 12, the payoff was between 40 to 80, which is moderate.

**Conclusion**: 

- **Route O-L-R-D** yielded the highest payoffs in recent rounds and seems to be a route that others are also inclined to take when they want to avoid the congested O-R-D. 
- However, being cautious of overcrowding is key; ideally not going beyond 15 agents maintains a good payoff.

For Round 19, it would be strategically wise to choose the route that has consistently provided higher payoffs and seems less prone to overcrowding than O-R-D, considering previous agent distributions.

Thus, for round 19, the recommended strategy is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 20:
To make an informed decision for Round 20, let's analyze the patterns and outcomes from the previous rounds:

1. **Route Performance**:
   - **O-L-D**: This route was chosen in Round 2, 16 and generally resulted in a lower payoff when many participants chose it (e.g., Round 2). However, when fewer agents chose it, as in Round 16, the payoff was better.
   - **O-L-R-D**: This route has consistently provided high payoffs, particularly in Rounds 8, 9, 14, 17, 18, and 19, where the payoff was generally higher compared to other routes. It seems less sensitive to the number of agents because of the fixed costs on certain segments.
   - **O-R-D**: This route was chosen frequently in earlier rounds. It was most beneficial when fewer participants chose it (e.g., Round 5). However, it becomes costly when more participants opt for it due to the variable costs on the R-D segment.

2. **Participant Distribution**:
   - The distribution of agents among the routes has varied, but in recent rounds, fewer agents have chosen O-R-D, resulting in a moderate payoff.
   - O-L-R-D has been popular but seems to still provide decent payoffs even when chosen by a larger number of agents.

3. **Recent Trends**:
   - In the last few rounds, O-L-R-D has provided reliable payoffs and seems to be a safer choice given the pattern of agents not overwhelmingly choosing it compared to O-R-D.

Given this analysis, I will choose **O-L-R-D** for Round 20 as it appears to provide a consistently higher payoff compared to the other options, taking into account both the number of agents that have chosen it previously and the cost patterns. Here is my decision in the required JSON format:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 21:
To determine which route to choose in round 21, let's analyze the patterns from the previous rounds:

1. **Understanding Cost Structure**:
   - Route O-L-D has variable costs on the O-L segment, where cost increases with the number of users due to congestion, plus a fixed cost on L-D.
   - Route O-L-R-D has a variable cost on O-L, then zero cost on L-R, but again a variable cost on R-D.
   - Route O-R-D has a fixed cost on O-R and a variable cost on R-D.

2. **Historical Analysis**:
   - High payoff rounds correlate with fewer users on the chosen route, minimizing congestion costs.
   - Rounds 14 and 18, for example, show high payoffs (110 and 130) when choosing the O-L-R-D route with 11 and 9 agents respectively on that route. 
   - When the O-R-D route was chosen with around 3 agents (rounds like 10 and 12), the payoff was relatively lower (60 and 50), possibly due to higher overall costs.

3. **Recent Trends**:
   - In recent rounds, O-L-R-D has been the most frequently chosen route, occasionally resulting in congestion when over 13-14 drivers use it, leading to lower payoffs.
   - Routes O-L-D and O-R-D have seen variable use, but recent rounds indicate a slight preference for O-L-D by 5 users.

4. **Strategy for Round 21**:
   - Avoid the most popular route to minimize congestion costs.
   - Consider the recent choice pattern; O-L-D has lesser congestion if fewer than 5 drivers choose it.
   - The O-L-R-D route provided high payoffs when chosen by around 9-12 agents.

Given these considerations, selecting a route less frequently chosen in recent rounds with potential lower congestion costs seems optimal. Therefore, choosing **O-L-R-D** could maximize the payoff if the number of users is moderate, similar to previous high-payoff rounds.

Based on this analysis, the choice for round 21 is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 22:
To make the decision for round 22, let's analyze the information from the previous rounds and identify patterns:

1. **Routes and Costs:**
   - **O-L-D:** Cost is highly variable based on the number of users on segment O-L, but has fixed cost on L-D.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Costs are variable on segment O-L and on segment R-D, but segment L-R has no additional cost.
   - **O-R-D:** Has a fixed cost on segment O-R and variable on R-D. 

2. **Past Rounds Analysis:**  
   - High Payoffs: The highest payoffs (100, 110, 130) happened when the choice was O-L-R-D and there were very few other agents on O-R-D.
   - Low Payoffs: Low payoffs are generally observed in rounds where I chose either O-R-D or O-L-D in congestion scenarios or when O-L-R-D had too many other agents (e.g., 17 in Round 15).

3. **Route Selection Patterns:**
   - Route **O-R-D**: This route has resulted in mixed payoffs. If fewer agents are on R-D, the costs stabilize towards 260. If more agents choose this route, costs increase significantly.
   - Route **O-L-R-D**: Often results in higher payoff when not chosen by too many agents (highest achievable payoff appears when others did not crowd it).
   - Changing Trends: Initially O-R-D had more agents, recently (especially in Round 21) O-L-R-D has few but consistent choices, leading to decent payoffs.

4. **Recent Round Patterns:**
   - There is a trend where other players seem to favor O-L-D and O-L-R-D more often, splitting mostly between these rather than O-R-D.

Given this analysis, to maximize payoff:
- Selecting **O-L-R-D** seems the preferable option based on my historically better results when route selection was carefully balanced.
- I should avoid O-R-D due to historically high variability and unpredictable crowding.
- Avoiding O-L-D due to potential high variable cost from segment O-L being crowded unexpectedly.

Taking all this into consideration, my strategic choice for round 22 is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 23:
To make the best decision for route selection in round 23, we need to analyze the trends and payoffs from previous rounds. Here is a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Examine the Payoffs**: 
   - The route "O-L-R-D" has frequently provided high payoffs, especially notable in rounds 8 (100 points), 14 (110 points), and 18 (130 points).
   - The route "O-R-D", while occasionally providing moderate payoffs, has generally resulted in lower payoffs, evident in rounds 2, 3, and 11.
   - The route "O-L-D" has not consistently provided high payoffs and is often chosen by fewer participants.

2. **Participant Distribution**:
   - The "O-L-R-D" route often sees more participants but tends to provide the highest or near-highest payoffs despite increased congestion.
   - The "O-R-D" route can become quickly congested, as seen in rounds 1 and 3, yielding lower payoffs.

3. **Choice Pattern**:
   - It seems advantageous when the "O-L-R-D" route is chosen by 10-14 participants as it generally results in a better payoff.
   - "O-L-D" seems to be the least chosen route but doesn't offer significant advantages in terms of payoffs when less congested.

4. **Strategy Forward**:
   - Given the data, the route "O-L-R-D" appears to be more reliable for higher average payoffs even with moderate levels of congestion. 

Considering these elements, the logical decision based on observed trends and potential payoffs would be to choose the "O-L-R-D" route again for round 23. This choice balances risk (from potential congestion) with the likelihood of achieving better payoffs.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 24:
To choose the optimal route for round 24, we should analyze the prior rounds and identify any patterns that suggest a more favorable outcome.

1. **Observation of Routes**:
    - **Route O-L-D**: Very few agents have chosen this route in most rounds. It has been historically less used, which may lead to lower congestion and better payoffs, but it can become costly when a few agents choose it due to its increasing cost.
    - **Route O-L-R-D**: This route has shown varied popularity. Often, it tends to have a medium to high number of agents, leading to variable high costs, but it seems to strike a balance with relatively more consistent outcomes.
    - **Route O-R-D**: Often chosen, with a fixed cost segment, making it quite popular. However, high numbers of agents lead to significant costs due to congestion affecting the R-D segment.

2. **Past Round Analysis**:
    - High payoff rounds (more than 50 points) are noticed mainly with route choices on O-L-R-D, specifically when fewer agents chose this route.
    - Choosing O-L-R-D in rounds with a balanced distribution of agents (like 10-11 agents), resulted in better payoffs (70, 100, 110, 120, 130 points).

3. **Decision Strategy**:
    - O-L-R-D seems to offer a chance for a better payoff due to its structure allowing for some relief on costs through L-R segment.
    - Given the prior data and the strategy of minimizing competitors on the same route, O-L-R-D has yielded consistent payoffs when not overcrowded.

Based on these findings, I should choose route O-L-R-D for round 24 to potentially achieve a better payoff. Here's the JSON output reflecting the decision:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 25:
To make a well-informed decision for Round 25, let's analyze the patterns from previous rounds and focus on minimizing costs to maximize payoffs.

### Step 1: Evaluate Route Options

1. **O-L-D:**
   - Cost depends on congestion on segment O-L.
   - More agents choosing this route increases individual cost.
   
2. **O-L-R-D:**
   - Moderate historical costs from low congestion.
   - Benefit: Fixed cost on segment L-R, allowing cost control based on segment O-L congestion.
   - Historical high payoff in some rounds.

3. **O-R-D:**
   - Involves fixed cost on O-R; congestion-dependent cost on R-D.
   - Has not consistently resulted in high payoffs.

### Step 2: Analyze Historical Choices and Payoffs

- **High Payoff Patterns in O-L-R-D**: 
  - Good payoffs observed when total agents on O-L-R-D were roughly 10-11 (e.g., Rounds 18, 24).
- Shifting choices between the routes based on congestion has resulted in varying payoffs. 

### Step 3: Make a Prediction

- Given the risk of unpredictable congestion on O-L and O-R-D experienced with the O-R-D route choice, selecting **O-L-R-D** should offer a moderate cost if moderate congestion persists.
- Assuming others split routes similarly to previous rounds or switch based on the randomness and distribution from historical rounds.

### Step 4: Choose the Route

Given the analysis and historical payoffs, a strategic choice would be continuing with **O-L-R-D**, which offered balanced payoffs with manageable costs compared to others.

### Decision

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 26:
To select the optimal route, let's first analyze the pattern in the previous rounds and the costs associated with each route.

1. **Route Cost Analysis:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** Travel cost = 10X + 210
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** Travel cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y
   - **Route O-R-D:** Travel cost = 210 + 10Y

2. **Previous Rounds Observations:**
   - **O-L-D** is chosen less frequently when there is a greater concentration on the other routes.
   - **O-L-R-D** has consistently higher agent use, especially in recent rounds (often 10–15 agents), resulting in moderate to high costs, yet attractive due to the 0 cost segment.
   - **O-R-D** historically offers moderate payoff, but can be crowded at times.

3. **Analyzing Recent Performance for O-L-R-D:**
   - O-L-R-D is the chosen route in recent rounds like rounds 18 - 25, with a variety of agent distributions.
   - When the total on O-L-R-D is around 10-11 agents, this route gives high potential payoff (payoffs being 110, 120, 130).

4. **Decision Approach for Round 26:**
   - Prefer a route that averages lower user numbers to optimize our cost, leveraging historical data.
   - Route selection should minimize expected user count while balancing potential costs.
   - **O-L-R-D is recurrently yielding high payoff** when user count stays ~10-11 agents.
   
Given this understanding, I'd select **O-L-R-D** for Round 26 as it offers a balance of historical payoff precedent and anticipated competition, and has resulted in high payoffs in similar preceding rounds.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 27:
To determine the optimal route for round 27, let's review the data and logic from previous rounds and analyze them step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Cost Functions**: 
   - Route O-L-D: The cost is 10X (for O-L) + 210 (for L-D), where X is the number of participants who choose segment O-L. 
   - Route O-L-R-D: The cost is 10X (for O-L) + 0 (for L-R) + 10Y (for R-D), where X is the number of participants on O-L and Y on R-D.
   - Route O-R-D: Fixed cost of 210 for O-R and 10Y for R-D.

2. **Observations from Previous Rounds**:
   - When choosing route O-R-D, payoffs ranged from 10 to 80, with few participants choosing it when payoff was higher.
   - When choosing route O-L-R-D, payoffs have been as high as 130, with a general trend of more agents, leading to higher costs as the number increases.
   - Route O-L-D typically wasn't chosen often by you, resulting in low payoffs when it was chosen, given the high number of agents on O-L.
   
3. **Recent Trend Analysis**:
   - Routes O-L-R-D and O-R-D have seen variability in agent distribution. 

4. **Strategy**:
   - Aim for a route that minimizes the competition on variable segments (O-L and R-D).
   - Monitor past distribution to predict least congested route, favoring lower cost from fewer agents sharing segments.

5. **Decision for Round 27**:
   - Route O-L-R-D has consistently yielded higher payoffs compared to the others despite occasional surges in agent counts due to its added flexibility and potential lower congestion on O-L.
   - Thus, choosing this route given the recent trends where other routes had relatively fewer agents might maximize expected payoffs.

Therefore, based on the analysis, I will choose the route O-L-R-D for round 27.

Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
  "route": "O-L-R-D"
}
```

Round 28:
To make the best decision for round 28, let's analyze the data provided from previous rounds:

1. **Identify Trends and Patterns:**
   - The routes available have varying popularity, impacting the cost due to the congestion effect.
   - It seems that in recent rounds, you've mostly chosen the route 'O-L-R-D', which offers consistent returns with payoffs mostly above 70.
   - Occasionally, choosing 'O-R-D' has provided high payoffs depending on the number of drivers on that route.

2. **Route Specific Costs:**
   - 'O-L-D': Cost is highly dependent on the first segment (O-L), and has seen fluctuating popularity. Can be costly if more agents select it.
   - 'O-L-R-D': Consistently provides a higher payoff, suggesting that congestion is often lower on the segments involved.
   - 'O-R-D': Lowest fixed cost on the first segment (O-R), but can be very costly if more drivers select the second segment (R-D).

3. **Round 27 Indicators:**
   - For 'O-L-R-D', 12 drivers resulted in a payoff of 100. As in the past, this payoff tends to remain high unless the number of drivers significantly increases.
   - 'O-R-D' appears to be less chosen recently, with only 3 people in the last round, which suggests it could be less congested in upcoming rounds if the trend continues.
  
4. **Decision-Making Considerations:**
   - Balancing risk and reward suggests sticking with routes where the payoff is more consistent and congestion lower.
   - Given that 'O-L-R-D' often results in higher payoffs (~100) in recent rounds, it's advisable to opt for this route unless we anticipate a large number of drivers suddenly choosing it.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - Based on recent rounds, 'O-L-R-D' has been the best performing and most consistent in terms of payoff due to moderate congestion levels.
  
Therefore, choose route 'O-L-R-D' in hopes of continuing to maintain a high payoff with moderate risk. Here's the choice in the format requested by the JSON schema:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 29:
To make a decision for Round 29, let's analyze the data from previous rounds and make a logical choice based on observed patterns and payoffs.

### Analysis of Previous Rounds:
1. **Preference Observation**: In most rounds, a significant number of agents have chosen the route 'O-L-R-D'. There have been high instances where more participants are choosing this route because it offers a 0 cost for segment L-R.
2. **Payoff Evaluation**:
   - **Route 'O-L-D'**: Generally results in lower payoff due to high participant numbers and resulting high costs.
   - **Route 'O-R-D'**: Has been chosen by fewer people in some rounds leading to varied payoffs. However, choosing this route was only beneficial when very few people chose it.
   - **Route 'O-L-R-D'**: This route has been frequently chosen by the user and provided payoffs generally ranging between 70 to 130. Particularly, low participant count on segment R-D significantly boosts the payoff due to zero cost on segment L-R.

### Strategy for Round 29:
Considering the above analysis:
- **Route 'O-R-D'**: Has lesser variation in costs, making payoffs more unpredictable due to dependency on segment R-D count which is very sensitive to increase in participants.
- **Route 'O-L-D'**: Tends to have higher cost unless very few choose to go this way.
- **Route 'O-L-R-D'**: While it has been the frequent choice for many in past rounds, it still offers a relatively consistent high payoff due to the constant low cost incurred on segment L-R and the absence of penalty when only a few choose segment R-D.

Thus, for Round 29, sticking with the more predictable and profitable route seems to be choosing the route with a trend of giving higher payoffs.

### Decision:
Based on the observed outcomes, I would recommend choosing Route 'O-L-R-D', which has given consistently higher payoffs.

Here is the well-formatted JSON output:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 30:
To make a decision for round 30, let's analyze the past data to select the most optimal route. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the decision-making process:

1. **Review Past Rounds:**
   - Routes and corresponding payoffs for the last several rounds are observed.
   - Route "O-L-R-D" has frequently resulted in favorable payoffs, often exceeding 70 points.
   - The "O-R-D" route generally resulted in lower payoffs when selected, indicating higher congestion.
   - The "O-L-D" route was chosen in two rounds with lower payoffs compared to "O-L-R-D."

2. **Trend Analysis:**
   - "O-L-R-D" has been a favorable option given the combination of agents choosing alternative routes.
   - In the most recent rounds (23-29), "O-L-R-D" consistently provided payoffs between 80 and 120, indicating less congestion compared to "O-R-D."
   - The number of agents on "O-L-R-D" was around 12-14 in the last rounds, leading to a balanced flow without excessive cost.

3. **Selecting the Route:**
   - Based on recent successful outcomes and the consistent payoff advantage, choosing "O-L-R-D" remains the optimal choice.
   - There is a reasonable expectation the other agents may continue choosing "O-L-D" and "O-R-D" in numbers that will maintain a favorable balance on "O-L-R-D."

**Decision:**

Given these observations from the past rounds, choosing the "O-L-R-D" route has proven to maximize payoffs effectively. Therefore, for round 30, the chosen route will be:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 31:
To decide on the best route for round 31, let's analyze the information we've gathered from prior rounds:

1. **Route Analysis**:
   - **O-L-D**:
     - This route has rarely been chosen by me, and when I did (round 2 and round 16), my payoffs were low: 10 and 50 respectively. This route tends to have fluctuating numbers of agents around a median of 3-5 agents but sometimes surges higher, impacting my cost.
   - **O-L-R-D**:
     - This route has consistently offered moderate to high payoffs, ranging from 50 to 130 points. This route seems to attract the majority of drivers (9-15 agents) in recent rounds, but costs were somewhat managed.
   - **O-R-D**:
     - This route's payoff ranges from 30 to 80, with fewer agents generally between 2-5, but often yielding low payoffs, except for few occasions when it was efficient with only 1-2 other agents.

2. **Distribution Patterns**:
   - From the data, it seems like the majority of agents are leaning towards choosing the route O-L-R-D. This is likely due to the balanced cost when the average number of participants remains substantial but not excessive.

3. **Payoff Maximization**:
   - To maximize payoff, it is critical to consider the historical cost-benefit seen in choosing the route and the tendency of others to potentially shift based on observed lower numbers on specific routes.

4. **Trend Insights**:
   - Recent shifts show even distribution among O-L-D and O-R-D, with O-L-R-D usually being preferable when crowd distribution is uncertain.

Given the usual crowd distribution patterns and the previous results from each route, selecting the **O-L-R-D** route appears to be the most balanced choice for the maximum potential payoff.

Based on these observations, here's the JSON output with my choice:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 32:
To make an informed decision, let's analyze the data from previous rounds, focusing on the routes chosen and the respective payoffs:

1. Route O-L-D:
   - This route offers a payoff of 190 - 10X, where X is the number of agents taking this route.
   - Historically, this route has not been crowded often, but when it is, the payoff drops significantly.

2. Route O-L-R-D:
   - Offers a fixed payoff of 200 when the route is not crowded and decreases as more agents choose it.
   - It has been consistently crowded, with agent count varying between 10 to 17.
   - This route has been my frequent choice and yielded varying payoffs. However, the high agent counts often reduce its attractiveness due to congestion.

3. Route O-R-D:
   - Offers a payoff of 390 - 10Y, where Y is the number of agents taking the route.
   - At times when fewer agents chose it, the payoff was decent. However, the payoff decreases sharply if many agents select it.

Analysis and Strategy for Round 32:
- The route O-L-D is rarely chosen by the majority and presents a higher risk if more agents switch to it.
- Route O-L-R-D remains crowded and generally gives a moderate payoff unless the number of agents is significantly high.
- Route O-R-D provides a high payoff potential if relatively fewer agents (specifically, if less than 4) choose it.

Given the past trends, the route O-L-R-D has been over-selected, making it less attractive.

Strategic Choice:
- Given the previous trends, the risk with route O-R-D is manageable if the number of agents remains low. Recently, it has been less crowded, thus offering a decent payoff potential.
- I will choose route O-R-D, assessing that fewer agents might select it given the recent congestion trends with O-L-R-D and past low preference for O-L-D.

Thus, my choice for round 32 is route O-R-D.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 33:
To make an informed decision for round 33, let's analyze the data from previous rounds. We aim to choose a route that will likely result in the lowest travel cost, thereby maximizing our payoff.

1. **Route Payoff Analysis**:
   - **O-L-D**: 
     - In round 16, the payoff was 50 when 5 agents chose this route.
     - Round 2 yielded the lowest payoff of 10 when 11 agents were on this route.
     - This route tends to have high costs when many agents choose it.

   - **O-L-R-D**: 
     - Frequently chosen, notably receiving payoffs like 130 in round 18.
     - Payoffs range from 50 (highest traffic: 17 agents) to 130 (manageable traffic: 9 agents).
     - This route offers moderate costs when around 10 to 13 agents choose it.

   - **O-R-D**:
     - Round 5 had a payoff of 80 when 4 agents chose this route.
     - Generally, the payoff decreases as more agents choose this route, shown by payoffs as low as 10 in round 3 with 17 agents.
     - The payoff increases reasonably when fewer agents use this route, as seen when 3-5 agents select it.

2. **Recent Trends**:
   - The last round (round 32) saw 3 agents choosing O-R-D, but it's unclear if this was an anomaly.
   - O-L-R-D has been regularly chosen by a substantial number of agents (10-14), indicating it's often preferred but should be avoided if congested (15+ agents).

3. **Decision Strategy**:
   - Our goal is to find a route with fewer competitors.
   - O-L-R-D often gives good payoffs when traffic ranges around 12-13 agents.
   - O-R-D has potential for high payoffs if competitor count remains low.

Given previous data and to optimize for a higher payoff, let's opt for the route with historical moderate payoffs under consistent traffic:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 34:
To make an informed decision for Round 34, let's analyze the data we have from the previous rounds:

1. **Consistent Patterns**: 
   - The route 'O-L-R-D' generally provides higher payoffs, with payoffs often over 80 when the number of agents choosing this route is around 12-14.
   - 'O-R-D' tends to lead to less favorable payoffs, especially when more than 3 agents choose it. 

2. **Fluctuation Among Routes**: 
   - 'O-L-D' is chosen significantly less often in recent rounds, indicating it might be less attractive for other players. This might suggest lower congestion, but can also imply high travel costs historically deterring player choice.

3. **Current Trends**: 
   - In the last few rounds, 'O-L-R-D' has been consistently chosen by 12-14 agents, usually yielding decent payoffs when chosen by around 12 agents, providing 100 payoff even when up to 15 agents chose it.
   - For 'O-R-D', the payoff dropped notably low when it was chosen by more than 3 agents.

4. **Potential Decision for Round 34**:
   - Given the patterns, choosing 'O-L-R-D' seems to be the safest bet for a decent payoff, as it has routinely offered higher payoffs and demonstrates a reasonable level of congestion control (staying close to optimal congestion levels).

Based on this analysis, here's the decision formatted as a JSON object:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 35:
To make a decision on which route to choose for round 35, I should consider the outcomes from the previous rounds. Let's summarize the performance of each route based on the data:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - This route was chosen in rounds 2 and 16, with payoffs of 10 and 50, respectively.
   - When chosen by fewer drivers, it tends to have a better payoff, but is generally less preferred and usually has a higher cost.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - This route has been my most frequently chosen option.
   - The payoffs vary from 50 to 130, generally offering higher payoffs when the number of agents using it is around 11-13, rather than 14 or more.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - This route was chosen in rounds 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 32.
   - The payoffs for this route range from 10 to 80. Payoffs seem better with fewer agents (around 3-4) but often this route has been overcrowded leading to lower payoffs.

**Observation & Analysis:**
- **Route O-L-R-D** seems to have consistently offered higher payoffs, particularly when around 10 to 13 drivers are using it. 
- **Route O-R-D** has the potential for decent payoffs, but is very sensitive to the number of drivers using it. It's best avoided if there's significant usage uncertainty.
- **Route O-L-D** has been less utilized, and payoffs have been unattractive in previous rounds, suggesting a lower likelihood of being cost-effective.

**Decision for Round 35:**
Given the analysis, the optimal strategy would be to choose **Route O-L-R-D**, as it has consistently resulted in higher payoffs when not overcrowded. Let's implement this decision.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 36:
To make a decision on the best route to choose in round 36, let's analyze the information from previous rounds and evaluate potential costs to calculate expected payoffs:

1. **Route Options Analysis:**
   - **Route O-L-D:**
     - Cost structure: 10X + 210 (where X is the number of agents on segment O-L).
     - Based on historical behavior, choosing this route results in very few agents selecting it. This implies potentially lower costs on the O-L segment.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:**
     - Cost structure: 10X + 0 + 10Y (where X is the number of agents on segment O-L and Y is the number of agents on segment R-D).
     - Historically, a significant number of agents have selected this route, so this often results in high costs.
   - **Route O-R-D:**
     - Cost structure: 210 + 10Y (where Y is the number of agents on segment R-D).
     - Sporadic usage in the past, which can lead to lower or higher costs depending on the number of agents opting for it.

2. **Historical Payoffs:**
   - **Route O-L-D** yielded no choice since round 16, and that round provided a payoff of 50 with 5 agents there.
   - **Route O-L-R-D** has been heavily selected in recent rounds. It often yields moderate payoffs, but can sometimes yield low payoffs when the number of agents is very high (e.g., round 31 with 1 agent on O-L-D and 17 on O-L-R-D).
   - **Route O-R-D** has shown high variability in payoffs (ranging from 10 to 80) depending on the number of other agents on the route.

3. **Speculation for Round 36:**
   - Based on the patterns, **Route O-L-R-D**, although popular, can often be crowded and lead to lower payoffs due to congestion.
   - Given recent trends of not many opting for **O-R-D**, choosing this route could potentially result in fewer agents using it, thereby reducing travel cost and increasing payoff.
   - **O-L-D** hasn't been chosen in any round since round 16 and may have low congestion, but previously received low or negative payoffs when there were significant agents present.

4. **Decision:**
   - Given the relatively lower congestion in the recent history of the **O-R-D** route, and its potential for delivering higher payoffs when less congested, it seems sensible to select this route this round.

Round 37:
To decide on the optimal route for round 37, we need to analyze the pattern of agent distribution on the routes from previous rounds and the payoffs received. Let's examine the data:

1. **Route Analysis**:
   - **O-L-D**: Typically chosen by fewer agents across rounds. Payoffs vary greatly depending on the number of agents, but risks being high-cost with more agents due to the variable costs.
   - **O-L-R-D**: A mix of high and mid-level payoffs historically, with agents typically favoring this route. The cost is consistent except for the variable segment at R-D.
   - **O-R-D**: When it has low agents, it results in high payoffs, but too many agents here cause the cost to rise quickly as seen in several rounds like round 3.

2. **Trends and Results**:
   - Historically, the **O-L-R-D** route often averages a moderate number of agents but also frequently higher. In most rounds, it's been a go-to choice for maintaining a stable payoff.
   - The **O-R-D** route, which can sometimes offer high payoffs, has shown mixed results, largely dependent on the number of agents. High agent numbers here lead to high costs.

3. **Decision Insight**:
   - Considering the most recent round (36), there were fewer agents on **O-R-D** (4 agents), resulting in a payoff of 60. Previously, it was generally chosen by a larger number but seems less appealing among participants recently.
   - **O-L-R-D**, being consistently chosen, offers a relatively predictable cost vs. pay structure.

Given that the strategy should maximize payoff and assume some predictability, **O-L-R-D** offers a balance of manageable payoffs and less unpredictability. 

Therefore, my choice for Round 37 will be:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 38:
To make an informed decision for round 38, it's essential to analyze the pattern of previous rounds and determine the best course of action based on the data provided.

1. **Identify Trends**:
   - Route 'O-L-R-D' generally yields the highest payoffs compared to 'O-R-D' and 'O-L-D'. There were rounds when the payoff was above 100.
   - Routes 'O-R-D' and 'O-L-D' have delivered lower payoffs frequently due to the high variable cost associated when many agents choose them.
   - The balance between the number of agents per route and payoff shows that 'O-L-R-D' has been more stable in terms of cost due to fewer agents relative to its reliance on fixed cost segments.

2. **Agent Distribution**:
   - It appears that when the number of agents in 'O-L-R-D' exceeds 12-14, the payoff tends to decrease, but it still remains competitive or better than the other two routes.
   - Rounds where 'O-L-R-D' had agents in the range of 10-12 tended to see higher payoffs of up to 130.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Other participants might also react sensibly to minimize their costs, possibly leading to variability in agent distribution each round.
   - Considering the past few rounds, route 'O-L-R-D' consistently yields better payoffs even when agent counts fluctuate slightly.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Opt for the route with lower risk and historically observed higher payoffs. Given other participants’ actions, 'O-L-R-D' continues to be a rational choice.

Based on this step-by-step analysis, the recommended route for round 38 is 'O-L-R-D'.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 39:
To decide which route to choose for round 39, let's first analyze the data from the previous rounds to identify patterns and deduce the best strategy:

1. **Consistently Favorable Route**: 
    - Route "O-L-R-D" consistently provided higher payoffs, especially when fewer drivers chose it. For example, in rounds where the number of agents on "O-L-R-D" was around 12-13, payoffs were generally better than in rounds with higher congestion.

2. **Comparison of Route Costs**:
    - Route "O-L-D": Cost fluctuates as it depends on the number of agents choosing it, which can lead to very high costs.
    - Route "O-L-R-D": Zero cost for L-R provides a strategic advantage; if other segments are less congested, this route is beneficial.
    - Route "O-R-D": In previous rounds, it led to lower payoffs when heavily congested. It seems to be less predictable if more agents shift to "O-L-R-D".

3. **Analyzing Trends**:
    - In recent rounds, "O-L-R-D" has been more frequent and provided good payoffs despite moderate congestion.
    - Minimal agents chose "O-L-D", suggesting it's less attractive unless others shift, but doing so can be risky for a single round's payoff.
  
4. **Strategic Decision**:
   - Given that other drivers likely notice their lower payoffs on "O-R-D" and may switch to "O-L-R-D" or "O-L-D", yet "O-L-R-D" has been consistent in providing better outcomes, staying on "O-L-R-D" could still be beneficial.
    
Considering all these factors, the optimal decision seems to be choosing the least risky route with typically better payoffs despite moderate congestion. Therefore, I will choose route "O-L-R-D" for round 39.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 40:
To decide on the best route for Round 40, I should analyze my past choices and the outcomes in terms of payoffs from previous rounds. My goal is to maximize my payoff, which is dependent on minimizing my travel cost on the chosen route.

Let's look at the previous rounds:

1. **Route O-L-D**: 
   - I chose this route in Round 2 and Round 16 with payoffs of 10 and 50, respectively.
   - The number of agents for these rounds varied, with a particularly high number in Round 2 (11 agents), leading to a very low payoff.
   - Completing this route depends greatly on the number of agents similarly choosing the segment O-L, increasing the cost substantially when crowded.

2. **Route O-L-R-D**:
   - I chose this route several times across rounds with varied outcomes.
   - Payoffs have generally ranged from 50 to 130.
   - Notable good payoffs were seen in Rounds 18, 23, and 30, where the number of agents on this route was relatively lower than 12 or sometimes 13.
   - This route seems to offer the chance of a decent payoff if not overly chosen by the majority.

3. **Route O-R-D**:
   - I chose this route frequently and it typically results in low payoffs due to high crowding or costs.
   - The best payoff I got was 80 in Round 5, with 4 agents. It provided a good result only when the number of agents choosing it was less than 5.

Key Observations:
- Choosing Route O-R-D is risky and likely results in a low payoff unless only a few agents select it.
- The Route O-L-D can also lead to a high cost when a lot of agents choose it, and it’s not very predictable.
- Consistently, Route O-L-R-D seems to provide better outcomes on average, especially when the number of agents is around or below 12.

Given these observations and the patterns in agent choices, **Route O-L-R-D** appears to be the best strategic option for attempting to maximize my payoff in this final round. It has provided high payoffs in past rounds and seems to be a resilient choice against fluctuations in agent numbers choosing it.

Thus, I will choose Route O-L-R-D for Round 40.
