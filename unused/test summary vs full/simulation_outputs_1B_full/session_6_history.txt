System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 10 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 10 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a well-considered decision about which route to choose, I will take the following steps:

1. **Understand Cost Calculation:**
   - Route O-L-D: The cost is 10X + 210, where X is the number of participants choosing segment O-L.
   - Route O-L-R-D: The cost is 10X + 0 + 10Y, where X is the number of participants choosing O-L and Y is the number of participants choosing R-D.
   - Route O-R-D: The cost is 210 + 10Y, where Y is the number of participants choosing segment R-D.

2. **Analyze Segments:**
   - Segment O-L: Used by routes O-L-D and O-L-R-D.
   - Segment L-D: Fixed cost of 210 when choosing route O-L-D.
   - Segment L-R: Cost is 0, applicable for route O-L-R-D.
   - Segment R-D: Used by routes O-L-R-D and O-R-D.

3. **Considerations:**
   - If many participants choose O-L or R-D, the cost for using these segments increases, meaning I need to consider likely choices by others.
   - Route O-R-D has a fixed portion of 210, making the cost directly proportional to participants on segment R-D.

4. **Potential Strategies:**
   - Choose O-L-D if I expect fewer participants on O-L.
   - Choose O-L-R-D if I expect moderate use of O-L and R-D.
   - Choose O-R-D if I expect few participants on R-D, as it has a guaranteed cost start point of 210.

5. **Decision:**
   - Given only three routes and potential uncertainties:
     - If I prefer stability and fewer variables, I might lean towards O-R-D, expecting moderate usage of R-D.
     - If confidence is high in less usage of O-L, O-L-D might give good results.
   - Assume more participants favor direct routes or minimal changes; therefore, expect potential crowding on O-R-D.

6. **Evaluate from Example:**
   - In the provided example, choosing O-L-R-D would have yielded a lower cost compared to O-R-D given 14 participants chose O-R-D.

Given the analysis, choosing route **O-L-R-D** might balance potential cognitive load against choosing the least crowded segments for this round.

The conclusion, based on minimizing costs while considering segment usage by others, is to choose:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 2, 'O-L-R-D': 9, 'O-R-D': 7}
Your payoff was 130

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision for this round, I will analyze the previous round results and adjust my strategy accordingly:

1. **Review Previous Round:**
   - Routes chosen by participants and their distribution were:
     - O-L-D: 2 participants
     - O-L-R-D: 9 participants
     - O-R-D: 7 participants
   - My payoff was 130 points, which means my travel cost was 270 (400 endowment - 130 payoff).

2. **Calculate Costs from Previous Round:**
   - **O-L-D:** Cost = 10 * 11 + 210 = 320 (X = 11, total using O-L)
   - **O-L-R-D (my choice):** Cost = 10 * 11 + 0 + 10 * 16 = 270 (X = 11 for O-L, Y = 16 for R-D) => This matches my cost.
   - **O-R-D:** Cost = 210 + 10 * 16 = 370 (Y = 16 for R-D)
   
3. **Understand Cost Impact:**
   - O-R-D is the most costly option due to high participant count on R-D.
   - O-L-D was expensive because of the high usage of O-L.

4. **Project Participant Behavior:**
   - O-R-D might still attract fewer participants due to its highest cost last round.
   - If players are rational and want to minimize cost, O-L-R-D and O-L-D might see more users avoiding the pricier O-R-D.
   - However, O-L has a high chance of being crowded due to the smaller initial group using O-L-D.

5. **Strategic Choice:**
   - **O-L-R-D Strategy:** If others shift away from O-R-D recognizing high previous costs, O-L and R-D segments will be more crowded.
   - **O-R-D Potential:** Taking advantage of potentially lower participant number this round on R-D since players might rationally switch.

6. **Decision:**
   - Choose route O-R-D, aiming to leverage others shifting their choices and potentially reducing numbers on R-D.

This time, I'll take a chance on the over-crowding of common segments (O-L, R-D) being reduced by players seeking less congestion, and choose route **O-R-D**:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-L-R-D': 1, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 170

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To decide on the best route for this round, let's first analyze the results from the previous round:

1. **Review Previous Round Results:**
   - Routes and participant distribution:
     - O-L-D: 16 participants
     - O-L-R-D: 1 participant
     - O-R-D: 1 participant
   - My payoff was 170 points, indicating my travel cost was 230 (400 endowment - 170 payoff).

2. **Calculate Costs for Each Route Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D:** Cost = (10 * 17) + 210 = 380 (X = 17 on O-L)
   - **O-L-R-D:** Cost = (10 * 17) + 0 + (10 * 2) = 190 (X = 17 on O-L, Y = 2 on R-D)
   - **O-R-D (my choice):** Cost = 210 + (10 * 2) = 230 (Y = 2 on R-D), which matches my cost

3. **Analyze Behavior:**
   - O-L-D was incredibly costly due to 16 participants using the O-L segment.
   - O-L-R-D generated the lowest cost given minimal usage on both variable-cost segments.

4. **Project Current Round Behavior:**
   - After experiencing high costs, it's likely participants might avoid O-L-D this time.
   - O-L-R-D may attract more participants seeing its previous round's low cost.

5. **Strategic Choice:**
   - **O-L-R-D Strategy:** Highly cost-efficient in the previous round with low usage, may become crowded this round.
   - **O-R-D Potential:** With generally fewer using in past, costs are moderate and may again see lower usage if majority focus on O-L variations.

6. **Decision Making:**
   - Anticipate likely shifts toward routes that had lower costs, meaning O-L-D may become less crowded, but O-L-R-D sees increased participants.
   - Considering strategic shifts, O-R-D may provide a balanced risk given its potential for fewer participants and manageable cost predictability.
   
Choosing route **O-R-D** once again appears strategically viable, especially if avoiding expectedly crowded scenarios on O-L:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 10, 'O-R-D': 8}
Your payoff was 10

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision this round, let's analyze the results from the previous round and adjust the strategy accordingly:

1. **Review Previous Round Results:**
   - Routes and participant distribution:
     - O-L-D: 0 participants
     - O-L-R-D: 10 participants
     - O-R-D: 8 participants
   - My payoff was 10 points, indicating my travel cost was 390 (400 endowment - 10 payoff).

2. **Calculate Costs for Each Route Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D:** Cost = (10 * 10) + 210 = 310 (X = 10 on O-L, though no one chose it, implying potential low costs if chosen)
   - **O-L-R-D:** Cost = (10 * 10) + 0 + (10 * 18) = 280 (X = 10 on O-L, Y = 18 on R-D)
   - **O-R-D (my choice):** Cost = 210 + (10 * 18) = 390 (Y = 18 on R-D), which matches my cost

3. **Analyze Behavior:**
   - O-L-D was not chosen at all, suggesting perhaps others anticipated high costs but may have seen too many move to alternatives.
   - O-L-R-D became the most popular choice, which increased costs due to heavy usage of O-L and R-D segments.

4. **Project Current Round Behavior:**
   - Following the trend of avoiding higher costs, O-L-D might interest more participants this round due to its potential cost advantage if perceived as less of a burden now.
   - With participants likely reacting to past rounds, some might steer towards O-R-D for potentially lower costs if O-L segments seem overcrowded.

5. **Strategic Choice:**
   - **O-L-D Potential:** Offers lowest costs if still unused, but may attract more due to its underutilization last round.
   - **O-R-D Strategy:** Previously proven costly, but less attractive to a majority if shifts into O-L lead to expected balancing.

6. **Decision Making:**
   - Balancing the reaction from last round, considering less expected participants may lean towards any one segment (O-L, R-D).
   - Take a calculated chance on route with minimal usage last, given less likelihood of large shifts collectively going back to it.

This time, I will choose route **O-L-D** for the potential lower cost strategy based on its previous complete avoidance, expecting not everyone will immediately reconsider it:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 17, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To determine the best route for this round, I'll analyze the outcomes and plan carefully:

1. **Review Previous Round Results:**
   - Routes and participant distribution:
     - O-L-D: 17 participants
     - O-L-R-D: 0 participants
     - O-R-D: 1 participant
   - My payoff was 20 points, indicating my travel cost was 380 (400 endowment - 20 payoff).

2. **Calculate Costs for Each Route Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D (my choice):** Cost = (10 * 17) + 210 = 380 (X = 17 on O-L), which matches my cost
   - **O-L-R-D:** Cost was not incurred, as no players chose it
   - **O-R-D:** Cost = 210 + (10 * 1) = 220 (Y = 1 on R-D)

3. **Analyze Behavior:**
   - O-L-D was heavily chosen, creating large costs due to participant saturation on O-L.
   - O-L-R-D was completely neglected, making it a potentially lower-cost choice for this round.
   - O-R-D saw minimal usage, resulting in the lowest cost between the options based on participant decisions.

4. **Project Current Round Behavior:**
   - Given the common shift toward O-L-D, participants may now consider other less populated options due to high costs realized.
   - O-L-R-D and O-R-D might see increased interest as players look to minimize costs and avoid over-populated segments.

5. **Strategic Choice:**
   - **O-L-R-D Potential:** Offers a significant opportunity for lower costs from its zero usage. Could attract others noticing the same.
   - **O-R-D Strategy:** Continues as a viable option if expecting minimum users prioritize it again.
  
6. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose O-L-R-D to exploit its complete avoidance last round, as participants may not all converge on the same under-utilized route.
   - Aim for balance by taking advantage of potential extremes of choice surprising competitors this round.

Therefore, selecting route **O-L-R-D** aligns with strategically minimizing potential segment overcrowding more efficiently given past complete avoidance:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 17, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a strategic decision for this round, I'll analyze the results and consider likely player behavior shifts:

1. **Review Previous Round Results:**
   - Routes and participant distribution:
     - O-L-D: 0 participants
     - O-L-R-D: 17 participants
     - O-R-D: 1 participant
   - My payoff was 50 points, which means my travel cost was 350 (400 endowment - 50 payoff).

2. **Calculate Costs for Each Route Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D:** Was not chosen, implying a potential low-cost option this round as it was completely avoided.
   - **O-L-R-D (my choice):** Cost = (10 * 17) + 0 + (10 * 18) = 350 (X = 17 on O-L, Y = 18 on R-D), which matches my cost.
   - **O-R-D:** Cost = 210 + (10 * 18) = 390 (Y = 18 on R-D), meaning the only user paid a high cost for being alone on R-D.

3. **Analyze Behavior:**
   - O-L-R-D was overwhelmingly chosen, making it currently the least favorable option due to heavy usage.
   - O-L-D had zero players, which reflects potential attractiveness this round if others flock to it for perceived savings.
   - O-R-D had minimal usage but is costly if the segment sees less crossover.

4. **Project Current Round Behavior:**
   - Participants will likely avoid O-L-R-D after noting the high cost due to overcrowding.
   - O-L-D could become attractive given it was completely avoided last round, offering a cost advantage.
   - Few players might stick with or move to O-R-D if expecting minimal competition for R-D.

5. **Strategic Choice:**
   - **O-L-D Strategy:** Offers significant advantage if usage doesn't swing back completely, as last round's complete avoidance opens this opportunity.
   - **O-R-D Potential:** Generally less crowded, but costs tied directly to R-D use, may see varying traffic if players split focus.

6. **Decision Making:**
   - Leveraging O-L-D seems promising for potentially lower costs given its previous avoidance, predicting some players will choose it but not saturate it entirely.
   
Thus, choosing route **O-L-D**, optimizing for the minimal previous use and seeking a probable cost-effective path:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To decide the best route for this round, I will examine the previous round results and anticipate potential shifts in player behavior:

1. **Review Previous Round Results:**
   - Routes and participant distribution:
     - O-L-D: 15 participants
     - O-L-R-D: 0 participants
     - O-R-D: 3 participants
   - My payoff was 40 points, meaning my travel cost was 360 (400 endowment - 40 payoff).

2. **Calculate Costs for Each Route Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D (my choice):** Cost = (10 * 15) + 210 = 360 (X = 15 on O-L), matching my cost.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Was not chosen, suggesting players avoided it completely perhaps anticipating crowding.
   - **O-R-D:** Cost = 210 + (10 * 3) = 240 (Y = 3 on R-D), which was less costly given the few participants.

3. **Analyze Behavior:**
   - O-L-D faced significant traffic leading to higher costs, potentially driving players to reconsider their choice.
   - O-L-R-D will likely appear more attractive due to its avoidance last round.
   - O-R-D had fewer participants, offering reduced cost if this balance continues.

4. **Project Current Round Behavior:**
   - Participants will likely shift to O-L-R-D, anticipating it to be less crowded based on no users choosing it previously.
   - O-R-D might maintain or slightly decrease in popularity with players seeking steady routes without competition.

5. **Strategic Choice:**
   - **O-L-R-D Strategy:** Could provide reduced costs if it remains underutilized now considered an option again.
   - **O-R-D Potential:** Offers a lower cost determining that it maintains or slightly increases in popularity with limited participants.

6. **Decision Making:**
   - Given the high number of participants on O-L-D last round, shifting away makes sense to potentially find lower costs.
   - Anticipate O-L-R-D becoming a choice for players; risk is a potential high rate if everyone chooses the same.

Choosing route **O-R-D** offers a stable expectation with minimal current use by participants, maximizing the reduction in competitive segment usage:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 10

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a well-informed decision this round, let's analyze the results from the previous round and strategize accordingly:

1. **Review Previous Round Results:**
   - Routes and participant distribution:
     - O-L-D: 0 participants
     - O-L-R-D: 16 participants
     - O-R-D: 2 participants
   - My payoff was 10 points, indicating that my travel cost was 390 (400 endowment - 10 payoff).

2. **Calculate Costs for Each Route Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D:** No participants, indicating potential as a low-cost choice if still underused.
   - **O-L-R-D (my choice):** Cost = (10 * 16) + 0 + (10 * 18) = 390 (X = 16 on O-L, Y = 18 on R-D), matching my travel cost.
   - **O-R-D:** Cost = 210 + (10 * 18) = 390 (Y = 18 on R-D), lower participant count kept costs high due to segment choice.

3. **Analyze Behavior:**
   - O-L-D was not selected, perhaps as players focused on well-trodden and perceived viable O-L-R-D options.
   - O-L-R-D became the popular choice, increasing costs significantly due to its segment crowding.
   - O-R-D had fewer users, leading to less congestion but still costly due to higher Y on R-D.

4. **Project Current Round Behavior:**
   - O-L-D remains attractive being previously unused, likely to draw players seeking lower-cost possibilities.
   - O-L-R-D has seen crowding, reducing the likelihood of it being overwhelmingly chosen again.
   - O-R-D shows potential but hinges on fewer players splitting choice effectively.

5. **Strategic Choice:**
   - **O-L-D:** Presents solid opportunity if fewer participants shift to it; factor in its complete avoidance could signal risk of large returning crowd.
   - **O-R-D Strategy:** Weighing on fewer participant expectation, aiming to avoid being hit by overflow targeting lesser segments.

6. **Decision Making:**
   - Given prior complete avoidance on O-L-D, attempt this as a lower-cost opportunity if anticipating others distribute differently.
   
Choosing route **O-L-D** is likely optimal considering last round choices and minimizing expectation of over-crowding based on historical choice attempts:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To decide on the best route for this round, I will carefully analyze last round's outcomes and strategize:

1. **Review Previous Round Results:**
   - Routes and participant distribution:
     - O-L-D: 16 participants
     - O-L-R-D: 0 participants
     - O-R-D: 2 participants
   - My payoff was 30 points, meaning my travel cost was 370 (400 endowment - 30 payoff).

2. **Calculate Costs for Each Route Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D (my choice):** Cost = (10 * 16) + 210 = 370 (X = 16 on O-L), confirming the travel cost.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Was not chosen, indicating a potential opportunity for a lower-cost option if ignored again.
   - **O-R-D:** Cost = 210 + (10 * 2) = 230 (Y = 2 on R-D), showing a relatively low cost last round due to fewer participants.

3. **Analyze Behavior:**
   - O-L-D was heavily selected, resulting in high costs due to segment congestion.
   - O-L-R-D had no participants, providing an untouched cost scenario last round.
   - O-R-D, though underused, had a practical cost indicating potential stability if chosen by few.

4. **Project Current Round Behavior:**
   - Excessive usage of O-L-D last round will likely push players to consider new strategies to minimize costs.
   - O-L-R-D, not being chosen, may become attractive as players notice the potential for reduced costs.
   - O-R-D remains a viable alternative, especially if assuming fewer players will crowd it.

5. **Strategic Choice:**
   - **O-L-R-D Strategy:** Offers the chance for cost minimization if players haven't mass-moved in anticipation.
   - **O-R-D Potential:** Good strategic play for those anticipating other players will avoid it due to last known cost benefits.

6. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose O-L-R-D for potentially the lowest costs, banking on the complete lack of use giving an open opportunity.

Therefore, selecting route **O-L-R-D** can effectively leverage the previous round's unutilized path:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To determine the best route for this round, let's analyze the results from the previous round and anticipate future behavior:

1. **Review Previous Round Results:**
   - Routes and participant distribution:
     - O-L-D: 0 participants
     - O-L-R-D: 16 participants
     - O-R-D: 2 participants
   - My payoff was 60 points, meaning my travel cost was 340 (400 endowment - 60 payoff).

2. **Calculate Costs for Each Route Last Round:**
   - **O-L-D:** Was not chosen, suggesting a potential cost advantage if usage remains low.
   - **O-L-R-D (my choice):** Cost = (10 * 16) + 0 + (10 * 18) = 340 (X = 16 on O-L, Y = 18 on R-D), matching my cost.
   - **O-R-D:** Cost = 210 + (10 * 18) = 390 (Y = 18 on R-D), indicating a relatively steady participant cost.

3. **Analyze Behavior:**
   - The majority chose O-L-R-D, resulting in high costs due to congestion on both its variable segments.
   - O-L-D was not selected, making it a potential target for cost seekers if they spread out this time.
   - O-R-D remained consistent, offering a midpoint stable cost that could become advantageous again.

4. **Project Current Round Behavior:**
   - Players observing high costs from O-L-R-D might opt to reconsider their route choice to something less predictable.
   - O-L-D may attract attention due to its complete avoidance, possibly lowering its risk.
   - O-R-D appeals due to fewer participants, potentially maintaining low cost levels.

5. **Strategic Choice:**
   - **O-L-D Strategy:** Offers significant cost-saving possibilities if not as many players converge on it.
   - **O-R-D Option:** Provides consistency and a potentially lower cost with fewer expected to crowd the segment.

6. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose O-L-D to optimize chances for lower costs given prior complete disuse and balancing expectations for participant distribution.

So, to maximize the opportunity for a lower-cost round given complete avoidance in the last round, my choice is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```
