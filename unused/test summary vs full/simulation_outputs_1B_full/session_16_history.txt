System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 10 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 10 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision about selecting a route, let's consider each available route and its potential costs in terms of strategy and expected outcomes. We'll go through the cost calculation and factors that could influence the optimal route choice.

1. **Route O-L-D**: 
   - This route starts at O, goes through L, and ends at D.
   - Cost Calculation: The cost for this route is \(10X + 210\), where \(X\) is the number of drivers who choose segment O-L.
   - Since costs depend on how many choose O-L, if fewer drivers choose this route, the cost could be lower. However, with 18 drivers, there's a likelihood some will pick this route, which increases the cost.

2. **Route O-L-R-D**:
   - This route starts at O, goes through L, then R, and ends at D.
   - Cost Calculation: The cost for this route is \(10X + 0 + 10Y\), where \(X\) is the number of drivers who choose segment O-L, and \(Y\) is the number of drivers who choose segment R-D.
   - Particularly this route has a variable cost dependent on both segments O-L and R-D. The cost could significantly vary if many participants choose this combination, potentially increasing the expense. However, it utilizes the 0 cost L-R segment.

3. **Route O-R-D**:
   - This route bypasses L and goes directly from O to R, then to D.
   - Cost Calculation: The cost for this route is \(210 + 10Y\), where \(Y\) is the number of drivers who choose segment R-D.
   - This route has a fixed cost on segment O-R, but the variable part is based on R-D. If many drivers choose O-R-D, R-D could get congested and costly.

**Strategy Consideration**:
- We want to minimize the cost and maximize our payoff. The strategic balance is predicting or reacting to the choices of others.
- If many choose O-R-D, then its cost increases, making O-L-D more attractive and vice-versa.
- A key consideration is equilibrial distribution: if most avoid one route to avoid congestion, the value of that route increases.

**Decision**:
Based on the analysis, choosing a mixed-route like O-L-R-D might balance the use of segments and potentially leverage the 0 cost in L-R segment, especially if players gravitate toward more direct but costly routes like O-R-D or simple O-L-D.

Final decision:
```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 2, 'O-L-R-D': 9, 'O-R-D': 7}
Your payoff was 130

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the distribution from the last round, let's analyze the situation and reassess our strategy for the current round.

1. **Review of Previous Round**:
   - The distribution of players was {'O-L-D': 2, 'O-L-R-D': 9, 'O-R-D': 7}.
   - Your payoff was 130, which is relatively low considering a max endowment of 400. This suggests a higher travel cost in the previous round.

2. **Cost Analysis**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 
     - Last round had 2 players on it.
     - The cost would have been \(10 \times 2 + 210 = 230\).
   - **Route O-L-R-D**:
     - This was the most chosen route with 9 players.
     - Cost would have been \(10 \times 9 + 0 + 10 \times (Players on R-D)\).
     - The segment R-D also has 9 players, likely leading to a calculated cost for O-L-R-D being \(10 \times 9 + 0 + 10 \times 9 = 180\).
   - **Route O-R-D**:
     - Had 7 players, with a cost of \(210 + 10 \times 7 = 280\).

3. **Strategic Adjustment**:
   - Given the results:
     - Route O-L-D offered a lower cost last round, with only 2 players, indicating less congestion.
     - Route O-R-D had a higher cost due to 7 players, and is typically expensive on the R-D segment.
     - Route O-L-R-D turned out to accumulate significant costs, since you chose it last round with a total expense that matched its positions in both O-L and R-D.
   
4. **Decision for Current Round**:
   - With O-L-D having only 2 players last round, it was more cost-effective. Assuming players may still converge towards O-L-R-D again, O-L-D could be the more balanced and cheaper choice under the current conditions as players may recognize the high cost of O-L-R-D.
   - Opt for O-L-D to potentially minimize costs assuming player distribution remains similar.

Final decision:
```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-L-R-D': 1, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the updated information from the last round, let's evaluate the options carefully for the next round.

1. **Review of Previous Round**:
   - The player distribution was {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-L-R-D': 1, 'O-R-D': 1}.
   - Your payoff was 20, which indicates you likely chose the highly congested route O-L-D, resulting in substantial costs.

2. **Cost Analysis**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 
     - With 16 players, the cost was \(10 \times 16 + 210 = 370\).
     - This explains the significantly low payoff, as the route experienced high congestion.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**:
     - Had only 1 player.
     - The cost would have been \(10 \times 1 + 0 + 10 \times 1 = 20\).
     - This route had the lowest cost last round due to minimal congestion.
   - **Route O-R-D**:
     - Also had 1 player.
     - The cost would have been \(210 + 10 \times 1 = 220\).
     - Less congested and would have been a better option than O-L-D.

3. **Strategic Adjustment**:
   - With the majority on O-L-D, it led to excessive costs. 
   - The best strategic move would be to shift away from the overused O-L-D route.
   - Both O-L-R-D and O-R-D had significantly fewer players, suggesting much lower costs.
   - The key is to anticipate if other players will also gravitate away from O-L-D.

4. **Decision for Current Round**:
   - Given that O-L-D was overcrowded, shifting to O-L-R-D could be prudent, especially since it had the smallest cost the last round due to low dispersion.
   - Opting for O-L-R-D might strike a balance by avoiding the heavily congested routes while having negligible congestion last round.

Final decision:
```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 10, 'O-R-D': 8}
Your payoff was 120

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's perform a step-by-step analysis based on the latest round's results to compose a strategic decision for the next round.

1. **Review of Previous Round**:
   - Player distribution was {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 10, 'O-R-D': 8}.
   - Your payoff was 120, indicating that you likely chose a route with significant congestion.
   - This suggests a larger number of drivers opted for O-L-R-D, increasing its cost compared to the previous round.

2. **Cost Analysis**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 
     - Had 0 players, thus no congestion.
     - The cost would have been minimal, \(10 \times 0 + 210 = 210\), which makes it an attractive choice considering no one chose it.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**:
     - With 10 players, your choice with a resultant cost.
     - Cost for this route: \(10 \times 10 + 10 \times 8 = 180\).
   - **Route O-R-D**:
     - Had 8 players.
     - The cost would have been \(210 + 10 \times 8 = 290\).

3. **Strategic Adjustment**:
   - O-L-D was ignored completely in the last round, making it a cost-effective option provided not too many players switch to it in the current round.
   - Both O-L-R-D and O-R-D had higher player counts, resulting in increased costs which ate into the potential payoff.

4. **Decision for Current Round**:
   - Since O-L-D had no players, moving to this route could offer a strategic advantage by leveraging the lack of competition on that segment.
   - Predicting that other players might stick to O-L-R-D or O-R-D given past trends, O-L-D appears to be the most attractive low-cost route if it remains underutilized.

Final decision:
```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 17, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Analyzing the outcome from the last round and planning the next move:

1. **Review of Previous Round**:
   - Player distribution was {'O-L-D': 17, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 1}.
   - Your payoff was 20, which indicates you likely chose the highly congested route O-L-D.

2. **Cost Analysis**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 
     - With 17 players, the cost was \(10 \times 17 + 210 = 380\).
     - This resulted in a very high cost, explaining the low payoff.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**:
     - Had 0 players, meaning no one chose it.
     - Cost of \(10 \times 0 + 0 + 10 \times 0 = 0\) if no one else converges there.
   - **Route O-R-D**:
     - Had 1 player.
     - The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 1 = 220\).

3. **Strategic Adjustment**:
   - O-L-D was extremely congested last time, leading to high costs. It's prudent to avoid it this time.
   - No one chose O-L-R-D, making it potentially the most attractive option if others don't converge to it all at once.
   - O-R-D had minimal players but still a medium cost due to its fixed portion.

4. **Decision for Current Round**:
   - Opting for O-L-R-D could be advantageous because it was entirely unused, suggesting potential for the lowest cost assuming not everyone shifts here.
   - If other players also decide to move away from O-L-D, choosing a previously unused route like O-L-R-D could yield better payoff.

Final decision:
```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 17, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the results from the last round, let's carefully consider the strategy for the upcoming round.

1. **Review of Previous Round**:
   - Player distribution was {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 17, 'O-R-D': 1}.
   - Your payoff was 50, which indicates a high cost from choosing the very crowded route O-L-R-D.

2. **Cost Analysis**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 
     - With 0 players, it remains the least used option.
     - The cost would have been \(10 \times 0 + 210 = 210\), making this potentially the most cost-effective route given no congestion.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**:
     - Had 17 players, indicating it was very popular.
     - The cost would have been \(10 \times 17 + 10 \times 17 = 340\).
     - High congestion leading to high costs.
   - **Route O-R-D**:
     - Had 1 player.
     - The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 1 = 220\).

3. **Strategic Adjustment**:
   - O-L-D was completely avoided, indicating an opportunity to utilize it this round assuming player distribution patterns change slowly.
   - O-L-R-D, despite being chosen heavily last round, might deter players this round due to recent high costs.
   - O-R-D maintained a lower player count and medium cost, but not as low as O-L-D given no congestion on it previously.

4. **Decision for Current Round**:
   - Moving to O-L-D is advisable, assuming other players react to the previously higher costs of O-L-R-D.
   - O-L-D ensures minimal congestion cost potential if it remains under-utilized, offering a strategic advantage if players shy away due to past crowding.

Final decision:
```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Based on the results from the latest round, let's re-evaluate our strategy with careful consideration:

1. **Review of Previous Round**:
   - The player distribution was {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 3}.
   - Your payoff was 40, indicating you were likely on the heavily congested O-L-D route.

2. **Cost Analysis**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 
     - With 15 players, the cost was \(10 \times 15 + 210 = 360\).
     - This high congestion led to a low payoff despite initially seeming a less chosen route in previous rounds.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**:
     - Had 0 players, suggesting no congestion.
     - The cost, if chosen, would essentially be \(10 \times 0 + 0 + 10 \times 0 = 0\) assuming no convergence.
   - **Route O-R-D**:
     - Had 3 players.
     - The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 3 = 240\), considerably less crowded compared to O-L-D and cheaper overall.

3. **Strategic Adjustment**:
   - Historically, when a route becomes overly crowded (like O-L-D), players often rotate to other routes in subsequent rounds.
   - O-L-R-D having zero participants makes it the least costly, assuming players do not all switch there simultaneously.
   - O-R-D saw moderate use but remained much less costly than the congested O-L-D.

4. **Decision for Current Round**:
   - Moving to O-L-R-D is a strategic option, as it ensures minimal costs if it stays underutilized relative to the past congestion on other routes.
   - The condition of other drivers often reacting and spreading to alternate routes could make O-L-R-D affordable if competitors choose predictably. 

Final decision:
```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the situation comprehensively and make a strategic decision for the upcoming round:

1. **Review of Previous Round**:
   - Player distribution was {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}.
   - Your payoff was 60, reflecting a significant cost from choosing the heavily populated O-L-R-D route.

2. **Cost Analysis**:
   - **Route O-L-D**:
     - With 0 players, it was completely unutilized.
     - The cost, then, would have been \(10 \times 0 + 210 = 210\), offering a potential low-cost route if chosen and remains underutilized.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**:
     - With 16 players, congestion led to higher costs.
     - The cost was \(10 \times 16 + 10 \times 16 = 320\), contributing to a much higher-than-average cost and lower payoff.
   - **Route O-R-D**:
     - With 2 players only.
     - The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 230\), didn’t experience the extensive congestion of O-L-R-D and was the second-lowest in cost.

3. **Strategic Adjustment**:
   - O-L-D again presents as a potential low-cost choice being ignored in the last round.
   - Probability stands that O-L-R-D will be less popular next round due to recent high costs, which could disperse the players to more cost-effective routes.
   - O-R-D showed moderate congestion, maintaining a more predictable cost level compared to the overused O-L-R-D.

4. **Decision for Current Round**:
   - Opting for O-L-D is advisable. The route was vacant in the last round, suggesting an advantage if it continues to be overlooked by others.
   - Strategic selection of underused paths based on observed player distribution tends to minimize costs efficiently.

Final decision:
```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Considering the results from the last round, I'll carefully analyze these to help make a strategic decision:

1. **Review of Previous Round**:
   - Player distribution was {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 2}.
   - Your payoff was 30, indicating that you likely selected the highly congested route O-L-D.

2. **Cost Analysis**:
   - **Route O-L-D**:
     - With 16 players, the cost was \(10 \times 16 + 210 = 370\).
     - High congestion resulted in substantial costs compared to the other routes.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**:
     - Had 0 players, meaning it was completely unused.
     - Theoretical cost would be \(10 \times 0 + 0 + 10 \times 0 = 0\) if chosen alone, indicating no congestion cost.
   - **Route O-R-D**:
     - Had 2 players.
     - The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 230\), exhibiting less congestion and standing as a moderate-cost choice.

3. **Strategic Adjustment**:
   - Players may now react to the congestion of O-L-D and search for less crowded paths.
   - O-L-R-D remains an attractive option with no one using it previously, making it potentially the least expensive assuming no major shift.
   - O-R-D witnessed minimal participation and moderate cost, suggesting stability in costs with more predictability relative to utilization.

4. **Decision for Current Round**:
   - Opting for O-L-R-D might be strategically beneficial given the previous absence of players, which promises to minimize costs if it continues to be less selected.
   - With the understanding that other players might revert to O-L-D again anticipating traditional patterns, a strategic shift to O-L-R-D seems suitable.

Final decision:
```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the results from the last round, let's carefully evaluate the situation to devise a strategic decision for the upcoming round:

1. **Review of Previous Round**:
   - Player distribution was {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}.
   - Your payoff was 60, suggesting you took the highly congested O-L-R-D route, leading to substantial costs due to the large number of players.

2. **Cost Analysis**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: 
     - Had 0 players, hence no congestion.
     - The cost would have been \(10 \times 0 + 210 = 210\), making it theoretically the least costly option given no congestion last round.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**: 
     - With 16 players, the cost was substantial.
     - The cost was \(10 \times 16 + 10 \times 16 = 320\), resulting in high costs because of the heavy congestion.
   - **Route O-R-D**:
     - Had 2 players.
     - The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 230\), making it less congested and relatively moderate in cost compared to O-L-R-D.

3. **Strategic Adjustment**:
   - Since O-L-D had 0 players, it represents a cost-effective path if others continue to overlook it or are reluctant to shift due to oscillating congestion.
   - O-L-R-D experienced high congestion, making it less attractive if players adapt and distribute themselves better in subsequent rounds.
   - O-R-D showed low usage and retains a consistent moderate cost.

4. **Decision for Current Round**:
   - Choosing O-L-D appears to be the most strategic option, predicting minimal costs if it remains lightly chosen given its unused status in the prior round.
   - Anticipating other players will avoid previously congested routes like O-L-R-D, moving to an underutilized route like O-L-D provides a potentially optimal choice.

Final decision:
```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```
