System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 10 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 10 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision about which route to choose from ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D'], let's analyze each route in terms of potential costs and strategy:

1. **Understanding the Routes and Cost Dynamics**:
    - **Route O-L-D**: The cost for this route is \(10X + 210\), where \(X\) is the number of participants choosing segment O-L. It means the cost will increase with more participants on O-L.
    - **Route O-L-R-D**: The cost for this route is \(10X + 0 + 10Y\), where \(X\) is again determined by how many are on O-L, and \(Y\) is determined by the number choosing R-D. There are no additional costs on segment L-R.
    - **Route O-R-D**: The cost is \(210 + 10Y\), where \(Y\) is the number of participants choosing segment R-D. The cost is fixed on O-R.

2. **Strategic Considerations**:
    - If most participants avoid a specific segment, opting for routes involving it might result in lower costs.
    - Conversely, choosing a route with very popular segments can result in higher costs.
    - Balancing between avoiding congestion (typically on O-L) and potential low congestion on R-D is crucial.

3. **Predicting Opponent Behavior**:
    - Generally, participants might initially be inclined to avoid O-L due to its variable costs but might shift strategies to routes like O-R-D if they find O-L unexpectedly congested.
    - Based on past decisions or hypothetical scenarios, one might forecast distribution, but without previous rounds' exact data, it's speculative.

4. **Decision Making**:
    - A strategic move could involve choosing a less obvious route initially to gauge others' reactions and then adaptively manage costs in subsequent rounds.
    - Given the potential distribution, it may be strategically opportunistic to choose **O-L-R-D** initially, capitalizing on potentially lower interaction at L-R and possibly evenly distributed effects on O-L and R-D.

With the analysis above, the decision for this round would be to opt for a route that potentially encounters balanced distribution while testing the response of other participants:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 2, 'O-L-R-D': 9, 'O-R-D': 7}
Your payoff was 130

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the results from the last round, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to make an informed decision for the upcoming round.

1. **Understanding Last Round's Dynamics**:
    - **Route O-L-D**: 2 drivers chose this route. The cost for this was \(10 \times 11 + 210 = 320\), where 11 is the total number of drivers using O-L (2 from O-L-D and 9 from O-L-R-D).
    - **Route O-L-R-D**: 9 drivers chose this route. The cost would have been \(10 \times 11 + 0 + 10 \times 16 = 270\), where 16 drivers used R-D (9 from O-L-R-D and 7 from O-R-D).
    - **Route O-R-D**: 7 drivers chose this route. The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 16 = 370\).

Given my payoff was 130, the calculations confirm I chose the route O-L-R-D with a travel cost of 270 points. 

2. **Strategic Analysis**:
    - **O-L-D**: This route had the least players and thus the obvious low competition on O-L last round. If players notice this, they might switch to this to lower their costs.
    - **O-L-R-D**: Had the most drivers last round. If this pattern continues, costs may remain high here due to congestion on both O-L and R-D.
    - **O-R-D**: The second most popular route, resulting in the highest cost last round. It depends heavily on how many drivers choose O-R again, but it is risky if congestion remains.

3. **Predicting Changes**:
    - Participants from O-R-D, who paid the highest cost last round, might shift strategies to lessen congestion costs, possibly moving to O-L-D.
    - There might be fewer on O-L-R-D due to the high maintained presence last round, which increases costs substantially.

4. **Decision Making for the Next Round**:
    - Considering the shifts, the optimal strategy could be to capitalize on lower expected congestion on a route traveled less last round.
    - **O-L-D** appears to be a strategic choice this round, assuming last round's drivers on less popular routes will move to lower their costs, potentially increasing players on my last choice (O-L-R-D).

With this analysis, the chosen route would be:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-L-R-D': 1, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the results from the last round, let's analyze the situation step-by-step in order to make an informed decision for the upcoming round.

1. **Understanding Last Round's Dynamics**:
    - **Route O-L-D**: 16 drivers chose this route. The cost was \(10 \times 17 + 210 = 380\) since 17 drivers used O-L (16 from O-L-D and 1 from O-L-R-D).
    - **Route O-L-R-D**: Only 1 driver chose this route. The cost was \(10 \times 17 + 0 + 10 \times 2 = 180\), since only 2 used R-D (1 from O-L-R-D and 1 from O-R-D).
    - **Route O-R-D**: 1 driver chose this route. The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 230\).

Given my payoff was 20, the calculations confirm I chose the route O-L-D with a travel cost of 380 points.

2. **Strategic Analysis**:
    - **O-L-D**: This route had the overwhelming majority of drivers and consequently the highest cost due to congestion on segment O-L.
    - **O-L-R-D**: This route saw minimal usage. The cost was significantly lower due to reduced traffic on both O-L and R-D segments.
    - **O-R-D**: This route was also infrequently used. Thus, congestion on R-D was low and resulted in moderately lower costs.

3. **Predicting Changes**:
    - Most participants who faced high costs on O-L-D, myself included, will likely switch routes to escape congestion costs.
    - This should mean fewer drivers choosing O-L-D and potentially more re-distributing to other routes.

4. **Decision Making for the Next Round**:
    - Given the previous results, choosing a route last round with fewer participants offers a chance at significantly reduced costs.
    - Both O-L-R-D and O-R-D could see new interest due to previously low costs, but O-R-D still maintains a flat base cost on O-R, which might be slightly safer.
    
Ultimately, balancing these considerations suggests opting for a route with potential for moderate cost exposure without heavy congestion:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 10, 'O-R-D': 8}
Your payoff was 10

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the information from the last round, let's conduct a step-by-step analysis to make an informed decision for the upcoming round.

1. **Understanding Last Round's Dynamics**:
    - **Route O-L-D**: 0 drivers chose this route. Theoretically, this means the cost would have been solely determined by a base cost of 210, but no drivers incurred any cost from it.
    - **Route O-L-R-D**: 10 drivers chose this route. The cost was \(10 \times 10 + 0 + 10 \times 18 = 280\), where 10 drivers were on O-L and 18 were using R-D.
    - **Route O-R-D**: 8 drivers chose this route. The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 18 = 390\).

Given my payoff was 10, the calculations confirm I chose route O-R-D with a travel cost of 390 points.

2. **Strategic Analysis**:
    - **O-L-D**: No one chose this route, which now presents an opportunity due to completely avoided congestion costs associated with O-L.
    - **O-L-R-D**: Had the highest number of drivers last round, leading to heavy costs on segment R-D.
    - **O-R-D**: Also faced high costs on segment R-D, though presenting a lower fixed cost than O-L-R-D without any congestion on O-L.

3. **Predicting Changes**:
    - Drivers from O-R-D will likely seek lower-cost routes after experiencing high costs. There’s potential for them to shift to O-L-D, given 0 participation there previously.
    - Similarly, drivers from O-L-R-D might try the now-vacant O-L-D route for lower costs.

4. **Decision Making for the Next Round**:
    - **O-L-D** now stands out as a strategically sensible choice. Although some drivers could switch to this route, the complete avoidance last round suggests reduced immediate congestion, allowing for a lower cost if not overly crowded.

Thus, considering these factors, the next move would be:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 17, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the information from the last round, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to make an informed decision for the next round.

1. **Understanding Last Round's Dynamics**:
    - **Route O-L-D**: 17 drivers chose this route. The cost was \(10 \times 17 + 210 = 380\), due to heavy congestion on segment O-L.
    - **Route O-L-R-D**: 0 drivers chose this route. This means no costs were incurred here, leading to potentially very low travel costs were someone to choose it.
    - **Route O-R-D**: 1 driver chose this route. The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 1 = 220\), which confirms how a low number of drivers can aid in reducing congestion costs.

Given my payoff was 20, the calculations confirm I chose route O-L-D with a travel cost of 380 points.

2. **Strategic Analysis**:
    - **O-L-D**: Experienced the highest congestion, leading to significant costs. Many drivers might seek alternative routes to avoid high congestion costs.
    - **O-L-R-D**: With no drivers last round, this route presents a potentially low-cost opportunity without the congestion costs on O-L or R-D.
    - **O-R-D**: Had low participation last round, resulting in reduced costs on R-D, but still faced a higher base cost due to fixed charges on O-R.

3. **Predicting Changes**:
    - Participants from O-L-D, including myself, are likely to shift strategies to avoid high congestion costs. O-L-R-D now appears favorable due to zero participants last round.
    - O-R-D drivers may stick given lower costs, but many from O-L-D might also consider this.

4. **Decision Making for the Next Round**:
    - **O-L-R-D** is a more strategic choice given its complete vacancy last round. It balances a move towards minimizing congestion costs previously experienced by providing a cost-effective path devoid of drivers.

Thus, weighing these considerations, the next chosen route would be:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 17, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the results from the last round, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to make a strategic decision for the upcoming round.

1. **Understanding Last Round's Dynamics**:
    - **Route O-L-D**: 0 drivers chose this route. This indicates no congestion costs, implying the cost would be a fixed 210, given the base cost of segment L-D.
    - **Route O-L-R-D**: 17 drivers chose this route. The cost was \(10 \times 17 + 0 + 10 \times 18 = 350\), assuming 18 drivers used R-D (17 from O-L-R-D and 1 from O-R-D).
    - **Route O-R-D**: 1 driver chose this route. The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 18 = 390\), largely due to minimal participation but congested R-D.

Given my payoff was 50, this confirms I chose route O-L-R-D with a travel cost of 350 points.

2. **Strategic Analysis**:
    - **O-L-D**: No one chose this route, suggesting a compelling opportunity for much lower costs if not too many switch to it.
    - **O-L-R-D**: Saw significant participation and high costs due to R-D congestion; likely to deter some drivers.
    - **O-R-D**: Minimal participation could attract those seeking reduced congestion, but R-D remains congested without shifts.

3. **Predicting Changes**:
    - Participants are likely dissuaded from continuing high-cost O-L-R-D, prompting shifts to other routes, particularly O-L-D, given no prior participation.
    - O-R-D might attract some due to stable low participation, though risk involves potential R-D congestion.

4. **Decision Making for the Next Round**:
    - **O-L-D** emerges as a prime candidate for reduced congestion impacts. Its past avoidance means low baseline and no waiting factor on O-L, though risk if many shift here.
    - Consider adjusting given reactions to high past costs.

Balancing these aspects, the strategic route choice would be:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the results from the last round, let's carefully analyze the data to make a strategic decision for the next round.

1. **Understanding Last Round's Dynamics**:
    - **Route O-L-D**: 15 drivers chose this route. The cost was \(10 \times 15 + 210 = 360\), due to the significant number of drivers and resulting congestion on segment O-L.
    - **Route O-L-R-D**: 0 drivers chose this route, indicating an opportunity for minimal congestion costs should any drivers select it.
    - **Route O-R-D**: 3 drivers chose this route. The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 3 = 240\), which was less than O-L-D due to a lower user base on both O-R and R-D.

Given my payoff was 40, the calculations confirm I chose route O-R-D with a travel cost of 360 points.

2. **Strategic Analysis**:
    - **O-L-D**: Experienced heavy congestion, suggesting participants might look to avoid it this round.
    - **O-L-R-D**: Remained unselected and thus potentially offers the lowest cost if not many switch to it.
    - **O-R-D**: Had moderate congestion, presenting a middle ground between a stable base cost and minor competition on R-D.

3. **Predicting Changes**:
    - Significant numbers on O-L-D means drivers suffering high costs may look to shift to routes with lower congestion.
    - O-L-R-D, completely avoided previously, might attract drivers given its potential for low costs.
    
4. **Decision Making for the Next Round**:
    - **O-L-R-D** presents as a strategic option since it was not chosen previously, indicating the potential for very low congestion costs.
    - The shift from O-L-D due to congestion and higher fixed costs on O-R-D make O-L-R-D likely appealing for minimizing expenses.

Considering these dynamics, the strategic route choice would be:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the results from the last round, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to inform our decision for the next round.

1. **Understanding Last Round's Dynamics**:
    - **Route O-L-D**: 0 drivers chose this route. This suggests that the cost would solely be the fixed cost of 210 from segment L-D if someone chooses this route without congestion on O-L.
    - **Route O-L-R-D**: 16 drivers chose this route. The cost was \(10 \times 16 + 0 + 10 \times 18 = 340\), where 18 drivers used R-D (16 from O-L-R-D and 2 from O-R-D).
    - **Route O-R-D**: 2 drivers chose this route. The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 18 = 390\).

Given my payoff was 60, the calculations confirm I chose route O-L-R-D with a travel cost of 340 points.

2. **Strategic Analysis**:
    - **O-L-D**: No drivers chose this route, creating a significant opportunity for notably lower costs, given no congestion on O-L.
    - **O-L-R-D**: Had significant participation, leading to high costs affecting R-D. Participants may avoid it due to congestion.
    - **O-R-D**: Although fewer people used this route, the base costs were still unattractive due to shared R-D costs.

3. **Predicting Changes**:
    - Many participants on O-L-R-D are likely to seek other routes with reduced congestion fees. O-L-D emerges as an attractive alternative due to zero prior congestion.
    - Given previous data, some might shift to O-R-D, but the known high fixed costs might limit its appeal relative to a vacated O-L-D.

4. **Decision Making for the Next Round**:
    - **O-L-D** is an appealing choice due to its zero utilization last round, suggesting minimized base and congestion costs.
    - The probability is high that participants avoiding past high costs may find this route minimally used this round.

Considering these factors, the strategic choice for this round would be:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the results from the last round, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to decide on the best route for the upcoming round.

1. **Understanding Last Round's Dynamics**:
    - **Route O-L-D**: 16 drivers chose this route. The cost was \(10 \times 16 + 210 = 370\), resulting from significant congestion on the O-L segment.
    - **Route O-L-R-D**: 0 drivers chose this route, indicating that this route had no congestion, thus offering a potentially very low-cost opportunity.
    - **Route O-R-D**: 2 drivers chose this route. The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 230\), making it the lowest cost option last round.

Given my payoff was 30, the calculations confirm I chose route O-L-D with a travel cost of 370 points.

2. **Strategic Analysis**:
    - **O-L-D**: Faced heavy congestion costs, likely making it less attractive if drivers are eager to find less congested alternatives.
    - **O-L-R-D**: Not utilized last round, suggesting it remains a very low-cost option due to no congestion on segments O-L or R-D.
    - **O-R-D**: Had lower participation, leading to reduced congestion costs, and could continue to attract some due to low previous costs.

3. **Predicting Changes**:
    - Drivers from O-L-D will be motivated to move away from high congestion costs, likely shifting to either O-L-R-D or O-R-D.
    - O-L-R-D might be more appealing next round due to its zero usage last time, suggesting a completely open route for low-cost travel.
    
4. **Decision Making for the Next Round**:
    - **O-L-R-D** appears as a strategic choice given its total vacancy last round, which should allow for minimal travel costs barring a large shift.
    - While O-R-D may attract some given previously lower costs, the segment R-D will still likely face congestion if former O-L-D drivers move there, making O-L-R-D optimal if participation is low.

Considering these observations and strategic insights, the route choice for this round would be:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the results from the last round, let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the best route for the upcoming round.

1. **Understanding Last Round's Dynamics**:
    - **Route O-L-D**: 0 drivers chose this route. This indicates no congestion on O-L, leading to a cost solely from the fixed charge on segment L-D, which would be 210.
    - **Route O-L-R-D**: 16 drivers chose this route. The cost for this was \(10 \times 16 + 0 + 10 \times 18 = 340\), with congestion affecting both segments O-L and R-D.
    - **Route O-R-D**: 2 drivers chose this route. The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 18 = 390\), reflecting minimal participation but ongoing congestion on R-D due to shared route costs with O-L-R-D.

Given my payoff was 60, this confirms I chose route O-L-R-D with a travel cost of 340 points.

2. **Strategic Analysis**:
    - **O-L-D**: Unused last round, suggesting a very low-cost opportunity without congestion from O-L.
    - **O-L-R-D**: Heavy utilization led to significant congestion costs. Participants may avoid this route in favor of other options.
    - **O-R-D**: While less utilized, ongoing costs could dissuade some participants due to overlap with R-D congestion related to O-L-R-D.

3. **Predicting Changes**:
    - Participants heavily burdened by costs on O-L-R-D may shift to explore either O-L-D for minimized travel costs or other alternatives.
    - O-R-D might still appear attractive due to historical low use, but shifting from high-cost routes like O-L-R-D could affect cost dynamics.

4. **Decision Making for the Next Round**:
    - **O-L-D** emerges as a strongly favorable option due to zero usage, translating to minimal congestion and therefore lower travel costs.
    - As more participants realize the increasing costs related to high congestion on O-L-R-D and the shared R-D segment, shifts are expected, but O-L-D's prior vacancy suggests it remains optimal.

Taking these factors into consideration, the strategic decision for this round would be:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```
