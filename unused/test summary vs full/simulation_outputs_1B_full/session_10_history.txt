System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 10 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 10 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision about which route to choose, let's analyze each option based on potential costs and the possible distribution of drivers across the routes.

### Considerations:

1. **Route 'O-L-D':**
   - **Cost Function:** `10X + 210`
   - The cost is heavily dependent on how many drivers select segment O-L. If more drivers choose this route, the cost could escalate quickly.

2. **Route 'O-L-R-D':**
   - **Cost Function:** `10X + 0 + 10Y`
   - The cost here depends on both the number of drivers choosing the segment O-L and those choosing the segment R-D. This route has the potential to accumulate costs quickly if either segment is crowded.

3. **Route 'O-R-D':**
   - **Cost Function:** `210 + 10Y`
   - This route has a fixed cost of 210 for the segment O-R. The additional cost depends on how many drivers choose segment R-D. It carries a fixed starting cost but can also become expensive if R-D is crowded.

### Strategy:

- If I assume that most drivers will view 'O-R-D' as expensive due to the fixed cost, they might avoid it initially, leading to fewer people on R-D. However, if too many think alike, R-D may still get crowded.
- 'O-L-D' could be an option if I predict fewer people will choose it, keeping X low. However, this is risky since many might think it's a "safe" choice.
- 'O-L-R-D' has the potential for medium cost if the flows on both segments O-L and R-D are balanced and not overly crowded.

### Initial Decision:
Considering the start of the experiment where other participants may be unsure of others' choices, I'll assume that 'O-L-R-D' could potentially avoid direct competition, leveraging the transition point at R. It provides an intermediate escape if uncertainties arise on either segment of the route.

Furthermore, it's crucial to remember that with 10 rounds, adapting my strategy based on the observed choices of other drivers and outcomes from previous rounds will be essential.

Taking all these into account, my initial choice is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 2, 'O-L-R-D': 9, 'O-R-D': 7}
Your payoff was 130

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the situation based on the information from the last round and adjust our strategy accordingly.

### Last Round Summary:
- **Route Distribution:**
  - **'O-L-D':** 2 drivers
  - **'O-L-R-D':** 9 drivers
  - **'O-R-D':** 7 drivers
- **Your Payoff:** 130 points

### Cost Calculation from Last Round:
Given your payoff was 130, you incurred a travel cost of \(400 - 130 = 270\). Since you chose 'O-L-R-D':

- **Cost of Route 'O-L-R-D':** 
  - **Segment O-L:** \(10 \times (2 + 9) = 110\)
  - **Segment L-R:** Cost = 0
  - **Segment R-D:** \(10 \times (9 + 7) = 160\)
  
Total cost = \(110 + 0 + 160 = 270\).

### Analysis:
1. **Route 'O-L-D':**
   - Only 2 drivers chose this route, making it seem less crowded last round.
   - Cost would have been \([10 \times 2] + 210 = 230\).

2. **Route 'O-L-R-D':**
   - 9 drivers made this route's segments more congested, resulting in a higher cost.

3. **Route 'O-R-D':**
   - With 7 drivers, this route was less congested compared to 'O-L-R-D'.
   - The cost would have been \[210 + 10 \times 7 = 280\].

### Decision for This Round:
- **Observation:** 'O-L-D' was the least chosen route last round with only 2 drivers, leading to a lower cost if congestion remains low.
- **Adjustment:** Given the low number of participants on 'O-L-D,' it might be advantageous to choose it, betting that it remains less congested.

Considering these observations, I will choose route 'O-L-D' for this round, aiming to minimize my travel cost:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-L-R-D': 1, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Based on the previous round's results, let's analyze the situation and adjust our strategy for this round.

### Last Round Summary:
- **Route Distribution:**
  - **'O-L-D':** 16 drivers
  - **'O-L-R-D':** 1 driver
  - **'O-R-D':** 1 driver
- **Your Payoff:** 20 points

### Cost Calculation from Last Round:
Given your payoff was 20, you incurred a travel cost of \(400 - 20 = 380\). Since you chose 'O-L-D':

- **Cost of Route 'O-L-D':** 
  - **Segment O-L:** \(10 \times 16 = 160\)
  - **Segment L-D:** Fixed cost = 210
  
Total cost = \(160 + 210 = 370\).

### Analysis:
1. **Route 'O-L-D':**
   - Attracted most drivers, leading to very high congestion and cost.
   
2. **Route 'O-L-R-D':**
   - Only 1 driver chose this route, indicating very low congestion.
   - Would have incurred a cost of \(10 \times 1 + 0 + 10 \times 1 = 20\), very low compared to 'O-L-D'.
   
3. **Route 'O-R-D':**
   - Also only had 1 driver, similar low congestion scenario.
   - With a cost of \(210 + 10 \times 1 = 220\), it's higher than 'O-L-R-D' but safer than the highly congested 'O-L-D'.

### Decision for This Round:
- **Observation:** 'O-L-R-D' was the least chosen route last round, which resulted in a minimal cost. This makes it an attractive choice assuming other drivers may shy away from repeating the congested 'O-L-D'.
- **Strategy Adjustment:** Choosing 'O-L-R-D' should minimize costs if others continue to heavily select 'O-L-D' or avoid it due to prior congestion.

Based on this analysis, this round I will choose route 'O-L-R-D':

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 10, 'O-R-D': 8}
Your payoff was 120

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Based on the results from the previous round, let's analyze the situation and adjust our strategy accordingly.

### Last Round Summary:
- **Route Distribution:**
  - **'O-L-D':** 0 drivers
  - **'O-L-R-D':** 10 drivers
  - **'O-R-D':** 8 drivers
- **Your Payoff:** 120 points

### Cost Calculation from Last Round:
Given your payoff was 120, you incurred a travel cost of \(400 - 120 = 280\). Since you chose 'O-L-R-D':

- **Cost of Route 'O-L-R-D':** 
  - **Segment O-L:** \(10 \times 10 = 100\)
  - **Segment L-R:** Cost = 0
  - **Segment R-D:** \(10 \times (10 + 8) = 180\) (assuming you anticipated congestion accordingly)
  
Total cost = \(100 + 0 + 180 = 280\).

### Analysis:
1. **Route 'O-L-D':**
   - No drivers chose this route last round, making it entirely free of congestion.
   - Would have cost only the fixed segment L-D price: \(210\).

2. **Route 'O-L-R-D':**
   - With 10 drivers, this route experienced congestion, particularly affecting segments O-L and R-D.
   
3. **Route 'O-R-D':**
   - 8 drivers here led to moderate congestion on segment R-D.
   - Cost would be \(210 + 10 \times 8 = 290\).

### Decision for This Round:
- **Observation:** No drivers selected 'O-L-D' last round, potentially making it the lowest cost option as congestion entirely avoided it.
- **Strategic Opportunity:** Selecting 'O-L-D' has potential for very low cost if others continue to avoid it, or minimally move in that direction.

Considering these observations, I will choose route 'O-L-D' for this round, anticipating minimal congestion and thus lower cost:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 17, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Based on the results from the last round, let's thoroughly analyze the situation and adjust our strategy for this round.

### Last Round Summary:
- **Route Distribution:**
  - **'O-L-D':** 17 drivers
  - **'O-L-R-D':** 0 drivers
  - **'O-R-D':** 1 driver
- **Your Payoff:** 20 points

### Cost Calculation from Last Round:
Given your payoff was 20, you incurred a travel cost of \(400 - 20 = 380\). Since you chose 'O-L-D':

- **Cost of Route 'O-L-D':** 
  - **Segment O-L:** \(10 \times 17 = 170\)
  - **Segment L-D:** Fixed cost = 210
  
Total cost = \(170 + 210 = 380\).

### Analysis:
1. **Route 'O-L-D':**
   - Clearly, 'O-L-D' became heavily congested last round with 17 drivers, resulting in a high travel cost.
   
2. **Route 'O-L-R-D':**
   - No drivers chose this route, indicating no congestion and providing a potential hidden opportunity for a low-cost choice.

3. **Route 'O-R-D':**
   - With only 1 driver, the cost was relatively low, consisting of the fixed cost segment O-R and a minimal contribution from the R-D segment.

### Decision for This Round:
- **Observation:** The unexpectedly high congestion on 'O-L-D' suggests drivers react to past low-cost opportunities by quickly overcrowding them.
- **Strategic Consideration:** With 'O-L-R-D' entirely unselected last time, it holds the promise of minimal congestion yet again. This would allow the selection of 'O-L-R-D' as a low-cost option based on the typical response reversal dynamic.

Based on this reasoning and the importance of course-correcting quickly, I will choose route 'O-L-R-D' for this round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 17, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Based on the previous round's results, let's assess the situation and refine our strategy for this round.

### Last Round Summary:
- **Route Distribution:**
  - **'O-L-D':** 0 drivers
  - **'O-L-R-D':** 17 drivers
  - **'O-R-D':** 1 driver
- **Your Payoff:** 50 points

### Cost Calculation from Last Round:
Given your payoff was 50, you incurred a travel cost of \(400 - 50 = 350\). Since you chose 'O-L-R-D':

- **Cost of Route 'O-L-R-D':** 
  - **Segment O-L:** \(10 \times 17 = 170\)
  - **Segment L-R:** Cost = 0
  - **Segment R-D:** \(10 \times 1 = 10\)
  
Total cost = \(170 + 0 + 10 = 180\). However, based on the high lineup in both O-L and adjusted evaluations, it's consistent with congestion taking its toll.

### Analysis:
1. **Route 'O-L-D':**
   - No drivers chose this route, making it completely free of congestion and potentially the least costly option if congestion remains absent.

2. **Route 'O-L-R-D':**
   - With 17 drivers choosing this route, it became highly congested, leading to high travel costs.

3. **Route 'O-R-D':**
   - With only 1 driver, this route had minimal congestion, consisting mainly of the fixed O-R cost and low R-D impact.

### Decision for This Round:
- **Observation:** 'O-L-D' was entirely avoided last round, leading to no congestion and potentially the lowest cost for this round.
- **Strategic Shift:** Based on typical behavioral patterns where avoidance of congested routes is likely, choosing 'O-L-D' seems advantageous to capitalize on low volume.

Based on this analysis and pattern prediction from recent rounds, I will choose route 'O-L-D' for this round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the situation based on the last round and adjust our strategy accordingly for this round.

### Last Round Summary:
- **Route Distribution:**
  - **'O-L-D':** 15 drivers
  - **'O-L-R-D':** 0 drivers
  - **'O-R-D':** 3 drivers
- **Your Payoff:** 40 points

### Cost Calculation from Last Round:
Given your payoff was 40, you incurred a travel cost of \(400 - 40 = 360\). Since you chose 'O-L-D':

- **Cost of Route 'O-L-D':** 
  - **Segment O-L:** \(10 \times 15 = 150\)
  - **Segment L-D:** Fixed cost = 210
  
Total cost = \(150 + 210 = 360\).

### Analysis:
1. **Route 'O-L-D':**
   - Heavily congested with 15 drivers resulting in a significantly high travel cost.
   
2. **Route 'O-L-R-D':**
   - Completely avoided last round, meaning no congestion and a potential for minimized cost if this trend shifts back.
   
3. **Route 'O-R-D':**
   - Chosen by only 3 drivers, resulting in moderate costs, primarily due to the fixed segment O-R cost. The R-D segment had minimal impact.

### Decision for This Round:
- **Observation:** A highly variable pattern with 'O-L-D' swinging from no drivers to heavily crowded in a single round suggests volatility and potential for avoidance.
- **Strategic Adjustment:** Given that 'O-L-R-D' was not chosen last round, it has the potential for extremely low congestion and cost if people now switch away from congested routes.
  
Given this understanding and the historical response trends, I will choose route 'O-L-R-D' for this round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Based on the previous round's results, let's assess the situation and decide on the best strategy for this round.

### Last Round Summary:
- **Route Distribution:**
  - **'O-L-D':** 0 drivers
  - **'O-L-R-D':** 16 drivers
  - **'O-R-D':** 2 drivers
- **Your Payoff:** 60 points

### Cost Calculation from Last Round:
Given your payoff was 60, you incurred a travel cost of \(400 - 60 = 340\). Since you chose 'O-L-R-D':

- **Cost of Route 'O-L-R-D':**
  - **Segment O-L:** \(10 \times 16 = 160\)
  - **Segment L-R:** Cost = 0
  - **Segment R-D:** \(10 \times 2 = 20\)
  
Total cost = \(160 + 0 + 20 = 180\) + misjudgment might have been on the impact or another segment, or imbalance has led more to this variation in costs.

### Analysis:
1. **Route 'O-L-D':**
   - Completely avoided last round, which suggests it has the lowest potential cost if drivers continue to overlook it.
   
2. **Route 'O-L-R-D':**
   - Chosen by 16 drivers, creating significant congestion and increased travel costs.
   
3. **Route 'O-R-D':**
   - With only 2 drivers, it had much lower congestion, comprising primarily of the fixed cost for segment O-R.

### Decision for This Round:
- **Observation:** Given that 'O-L-D' was completely ignored last round, this opens up the possibility for a low-cost route if others are wary of switching back quickly.
- **Strategic Adjustment:** 'O-L-D' becomes an attractive choice since it was the least used, minimizing any congestion-related cost increases.

Considering the pattern and aiming to minimize costs, I will choose route 'O-L-D' for this round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Based on the results from the last round, let's analyze the current situation and make a strategic decision for this round.

### Last Round Summary:
- **Route Distribution:**
  - **'O-L-D':** 16 drivers
  - **'O-L-R-D':** 0 drivers
  - **'O-R-D':** 2 drivers
- **Your Payoff:** 30 points

### Cost Calculation from Last Round:
Given your payoff was 30, you incurred a travel cost of \(400 - 30 = 370\). Since you chose 'O-L-D':

- **Cost of Route 'O-L-D':** 
  - **Segment O-L:** \(10 \times 16 = 160\)
  - **Segment L-D:** Fixed cost = 210
  
Total cost = \(160 + 210 = 370\).

### Analysis:
1. **Route 'O-L-D':**
   - 16 drivers chose this route, resulting in high congestion and substantial travel costs.
   
2. **Route 'O-L-R-D':**
   - Completely avoided last round, suggesting potential as a low-cost route if selected cautiously.
   
3. **Route 'O-R-D':**
   - With 2 drivers, this route had minimal congestion, resulting in relatively lower costs due to the fixed cost nature of the O-R segment.

### Decision for This Round:
- **Observation:** Given 'O-L-D's' high congestion, drivers might shift away this round, opening up chances elsewhere.
- **Strategic Adjustment:** 'O-L-R-D' offers a promising opportunity since it was entirely unused, likely allowing for minimal congestion and cost if chosen carefully.

Based on these insights and the need to minimize costs while anticipating others' likely moves, I will choose route 'O-L-R-D' for this round:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the previous round and consider the best strategy for this round.

### Last Round Summary:
- **Route Distribution:**
  - **'O-L-D':** 0 drivers
  - **'O-L-R-D':** 16 drivers
  - **'O-R-D':** 2 drivers
- **Your Payoff:** 60 points

### Cost Calculation from Last Round:
Given your payoff was 60, you incurred a travel cost of \(400 - 60 = 340\). Since you chose 'O-L-R-D':

- **Cost of Route 'O-L-R-D':**
  - **Segment O-L:** \(10 \times 16 = 160\)
  - **Segment L-R:** Cost = 0
  - **Segment R-D:** \(10 \times 2 = 20\)
  
Total cost = \(160 + 0 + 20 = 180\), noting that a typical previous mistake could be in calculation or unknown rounding in actual execution hits. Here the costs aligned mostly with dimensions predictable for response.

### Analysis:
1. **Route 'O-L-D':**
   - Unused, suggesting zero congestion and a potentially very low cost if chosen.
   
2. **Route 'O-L-R-D':**
   - Chosen by 16 drivers, leading to higher congestion and increased costs.
   
3. **Route 'O-R-D':**
   - With only 2 drivers, this route had minimal congestion and costs focused systematically across O-R with a low following impact on R-D.

### Decision for This Round:
- **Observation:** 'O-L-D' was entirely avoided, indicating it may provide a low-cost opportunity if congestion remains absent.
- **Strategic Adjustment:** Given its complete avoidance last round, 'O-L-D' becomes a tempting choice for this round with minimal expected congestion.

With the aim to minimize costs and trying to stay ahead of the tendency of other participants to switch based on prior trends, I will choose route 'O-L-D':

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```
