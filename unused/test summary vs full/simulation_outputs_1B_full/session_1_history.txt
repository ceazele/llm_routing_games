System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 10 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 10 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make the decision on which route to select, let's analyze each route and consider the potential costs based on the number of drivers choosing the same segments.

1. **Route O-L-D**:
   - Cost = 10X + 210
   - The cost depends directly on how many drivers choose the O-L segment. The more drivers on this segment, the higher the cost. By choosing this route, I take a risk if many others also choose O-L-D or O-L-R-D, as it would increase my cost significantly.

2. **Route O-L-R-D**:
   - Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y
   - This route involves two variable segments (O-L and R-D). My cost on this route will be influenced by the number of drivers on O-L as well as those on R-D. This could be a cheaper option if fewer people are choosing these two segments, but it's a gamble if many drivers converge here.

3. **Route O-R-D**:
   - Cost = 210 + 10Y
   - Here, the cost on segment R-D is variable, but the cost on O-R is fixed. If many people select O-R-D, the R-D segment cost will increase, making this route potentially expensive in case of congestion on R-D.

**Strategic Consideration**:
- Given 18 total participants, what route might they choose? 
- If I assume everyone tries to minimize their cost, they might avoid the route with two variable segments (O-L-R-D) due to the risk of high accumulated cost.
- Participants might split between O-L-D and O-R-D based on balance between fixed and variable costs.

**Decision Making**:
- If I choose O-L-D, I risk high costs if many others choose O-L-D and O-L-R-D.
- If I choose O-R-D, there's a risk if many others do the same because the R-D cost could skyrocket.
- Choosing O-L-R-D seems riskier because it involves two variable segments, which could mean unpredictable costs.

Given these considerations, a safer bet might seem to be the O-L-D route if I anticipate most players will favor the fixed costs of O-R-D to avoid the variability. 

Therefore, I would **choose route O-L-D** to balance the risk of overall participant distribution and potential costs. 

Here's my decision in the required JSON format:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 2, 'O-L-R-D': 9, 'O-R-D': 7}
Your payoff was 80

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: With the information from the last round, let's analyze and refine the decision-making process.

1. **Last Round Recap**:
   - **O-L-D**: 2 players
   - **O-L-R-D**: 9 players
   - **O-R-D**: 7 players
   - My payoff was 80, which implies that my total travel cost was 400 - 80 = 320.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If I chose **O-L-D**:
     - Cost = 10X + 210
     - With 2 players, my cost would be 10(2) + 210 = 230. Since my cost was higher, this was not my chosen route.
   - If I chose **O-L-R-D**:
     - Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y
     - With 9 players on the route and 7 players on R-D (since those who chose O-R-D also use R-D):
     - Cost = 10(9) + 0 + 10(9+7) = 90 + 160 = 250. This aligns with a possible choice but still doesn't match my cost.
   - If I chose **O-R-D**:
     - Cost = 210 + 10Y
     - With 7 players using R-D, my cost = 210 + 10(7) = 280. This cost is closer yet doesn't match my cost.
   - Thus, based on calculations, there is some discrepancy because my payoff was 80, meaning I had a cost of 320. This suggests an error perhaps in the number of participants or unexpected behavior.

3. **Strategic Consideration for this Round**:
   - Many went for O-L-R-D last round, which made it expensive due to numerous users on segments with variable costs.
   - O-R-D had a moderate number of users, suggesting it was seen as less risky but proved costly.
   - O-L-D had few users, indicating the least variable cost and may represent a balanced choice in this new round.

**Decision Making**:
- It seems that O-L-D, although less chosen, might offer a stable choice due to its underutilization last round.
- Expecting that players might adjust and redistribute, choosing O-L-D presents a lesser risk approach, as it might balance out with potentially reduced congestion.

Thus, given this analysis, my strategic choice for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-L-R-D': 1, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Based on the results of the last round, let's carefully analyze the situation and adjust our strategy.

1. **Last Round Recap**:
   - **O-L-D**: 16 players
   - **O-L-R-D**: 1 player
   - **O-R-D**: 1 player
   - My payoff was 20, which implies that my total travel cost was 400 - 20 = 380.

2. **Cost Calculation from Last Round**:
   - If I chose **O-L-D**:
     - Cost = 10X + 210
     - With 16 players: Cost = 10(16) + 210 = 370. This cost aligns closely with my payoff, suggesting this was likely the route I chose.
   - If I chose **O-L-R-D**:
     - Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y
     - Cost = 10(16+1) + 0 + 10(2) = 170 + 20 = 190. This would have resulted in a much higher payoff.
   - If I chose **O-R-D**:
     - Cost = 210 + 10Y
     - Cost = 210 + 10(2) = 230. This would have given me a bigger payoff as well.

3. **Strategic Consideration for this Round**:
   - The **O-L-D** route was heavily congested, raising its cost significantly.
   - **O-L-R-D** and **O-R-D** had only 1 player each, making them significantly cheaper.
   - Given this, many players are likely to shift away from O-L-D to balance the costs.

**Adjusting My Strategy**:
- To avoid the high costs of the previous round, it is crucial to opt for a less congested route.
- **O-R-D**, having a fixed cost with only one cost-sensitive segment, might attract more players. Still, it may remain an optimal choice until it becomes congested.
- **O-L-R-D** not only was less chosen last round but provides flexibility in costs spread across two variable segments, making it possibly cheaper with low user numbers.

Based on these considerations, the strategic choice for this round is to switch to:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 10, 'O-R-D': 8}
Your payoff was 120

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the results and costs from the last round, let's reassess and strategize for this round.

1. **Last Round Recap**:
   - **O-L-D**: 0 players
   - **O-L-R-D**: 10 players
   - **O-R-D**: 8 players
   - My payoff was 120, which implies my total travel cost was 400 - 120 = 280.

2. **Cost Calculation from Last Round**:
   - If I chose **O-L-D**:
     - I didn't choose this route because there were 0 players.
   - If I chose **O-L-R-D**:
     - Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y
     - Cost = 10(10) + 0 + 10(10+8) = 100 + 180 = 280, which matches my calculated total cost.
   - If I chose **O-R-D**:
     - Cost = 210 + 10Y
     - Cost would have been 210 + 10(8) = 290, which would have been higher than 280.

3. **Current Situation and Strategic Consideration**:
   - The **O-L-D** route was completely avoided, likely due to previous heavy congestion.
   - **O-L-R-D** saw significant use, aligning with the costs I incurred, indicating it became the most chosen route.
   - **O-R-D**, although moderate in use, resulted in less favorable outcomes for others compared to O-L-R-D.

**Adjusting Strategy Based on Behavior:**
- The expectation is that players might avoid O-L-R-D this round due to its relative cost last time.
- Given the complete avoidance of O-L-D, it may be ripe for exploitation if players over-adjust away from it.
- O-R-D appeared stable but remains impacted by the number of players using the R-D segment.

With these insights, the potentially optimal choice is to exploit the unchosen and therefore potentially cheaper **O-L-D** route, as players might neglect it again given past patterns.
Therefore, my decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 17, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the results from the last round, let's re-evaluate the strategy while considering player distribution and calculate costs.

1. **Last Round Recap**:
   - **O-L-D**: 17 players
   - **O-L-R-D**: 0 players
   - **O-R-D**: 1 player
   - My payoff was 20, which implies my total travel cost was 400 - 20 = 380.

2. **Cost Calculation for Each Route**:
   - **O-L-D**:
     - Cost = 10X + 210
     - With 17 players: Cost = 10(17) + 210 = 380. This means I chose this route last round.
   - **O-L-R-D**:
     - Not chosen, so no cost calculation needed for last round.
   - **O-R-D**:
     - Cost = 210 + 10Y
     - With 1 player: Cost = 210 + 10(1) = 220. A much lower cost had I chosen this.

3. **Strategic Consideration for This Round**:
   - **O-L-D** was heavily congested this round, leading to a significantly high cost. This indicates players were crowding this route possibly in response to previous patterns.
   - **O-L-R-D** was completely avoided, suggesting players were either trying to avoid uncertainty or over-optimized by avoiding it.
   - **O-R-D** with only 1 player, maintained a relatively low and stable cost.

**Adjusting the Strategy**:
- Given that **O-L-D** became heavily congested, the likelihood is high that players will move away from it this round due to the high costs experienced.
- **O-L-R-D** remains a viable option, as its avoidance indicates an opportunity for low cost if the pattern swings.
- **O-R-D** was stable and lightly used, indicating a potential advantage if its usage remains low.

To minimize costs this round, a strategic decision leans towards choosing a route with historically less congestion and potential for lower costs, which is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 17, 'O-R-D': 1}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Based on the results from the last round, let's carefully analyze the situation to make an informed decision.

1. **Last Round Recap**:
   - **O-L-D**: 0 players
   - **O-L-R-D**: 17 players
   - **O-R-D**: 1 player
   - My payoff was 50, implying my total travel cost was 400 - 50 = 350.

2. **Cost Calculation for Each Route**:
   - **O-L-D**:
     - Not chosen last round, so no cost considerations for me here.
   - **O-L-R-D**:
     - Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y
     - With 17 players on O-L and 17 on R-D: Cost = 10(17) + 10(17) = 170 + 170 = 340.
     - My calculated cost of 350 indicates I was likely on this route, with rounding or misalignment by 10.
   - **O-R-D**:
     - Cost = 210 + 10Y
     - With 1 player: Cost = 210 + 10(1) = 220. This route was significantly cheaper.

3. **Strategic Consideration for This Round**:
   - **O-L-D** was completely unused, making it a potentially cheap option if players overcorrect.
   - **O-L-R-D** saw heavy use, indicating it's now a more costly route and likely to be avoided by others.
   - **O-R-D** had low use last round and was relatively cheap, making it an attractive option if usage remains low.

**Adjusting the Strategy**:
- Players may move away from **O-L-R-D** due to high congestion last round.
- **O-L-D** could see players returning, which would increase costs.
- **O-R-D**, although underused, remains a strategic option if I anticipate low congestion.

Considering the strategic distribution of players and past behavior, the calculated lower-cost option for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 3}
Your payoff was 160

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the results from the last round, let's analyze the distribution of players and costs, then plan the strategy for the next round.

1. **Last Round Recap**:
   - **O-L-D**: 15 players
   - **O-L-R-D**: 0 players
   - **O-R-D**: 3 players
   - My payoff was 160, implying my total travel cost was 400 - 160 = 240.

2. **Cost Calculation for Each Route**:
   - **O-L-D**:
     - Cost = 10X + 210
     - With 15 players: Cost = 10(15) + 210 = 150 + 210 = 360. This was not my route due to the higher cost.
   - **O-L-R-D**:
     - Given it was unused, this route wasn't my chosen one.
   - **O-R-D**:
     - Cost = 210 + 10Y
     - With 3 players: Cost = 210 + 10(3) = 210 + 30 = 240. This matches my cost, suggesting I chose this route.

3. **Strategic Consideration for This Round**:
   - **O-L-D** was heavily used, which increased its cost significantly.
   - **O-L-R-D** was completely avoided, presenting an opportunity as players may continue avoiding it.
   - **O-R-D** was moderately used, offering a reasonable balance of low-cost potential given the limited number of players. However, if players move to this route seeking stability, costs may rise.

**Adjusting the Strategy**:
- Given the high cost on O-L-D, it's likely to see reduced usage this round.
- Players may start exploring O-L-R-D due to its complete avoidance last round.
- O-R-D, already tested, might maintain a stable cost if players continue to distribute evenly or shift significantly away from O-L-D.

Considering these factors, I am inclined to choose a route with a potential for lower costs given such distributions. Thus, choosing the least used route historically could prove advantageous:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Based on the results and outcomes from the last round, let's analyze the data to make a strategic decision for this round.

1. **Last Round Recap**:
   - **O-L-D**: 0 players
   - **O-L-R-D**: 16 players
   - **O-R-D**: 2 players
   - My payoff was 60, implying my total travel cost was 400 - 60 = 340.

2. **Cost Calculation for Each Route**:
   - **O-L-D**:
     - Not chosen last round, so no cost considerations for me here.
   - **O-L-R-D**:
     - Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y
     - With 16 players on both O-L and R-D: Cost = 10(16) + 10(16) = 160 + 160 = 320. This closely matches my cost (considering rounding or misalignment).
   - **O-R-D**:
     - Cost = 210 + 10Y
     - With 2 players: Cost = 210 + 10(2) = 230. Much cheaper than what I incurred, suggesting I wasn't on this route.

3. **Strategic Consideration for This Round**:
   - **O-L-D** was not used, suggesting an opportunity if players continue to avoid it, offering a potentially low-cost option.
   - **O-L-R-D** was heavily used and could be costly again if players redistribute poorly.
   - **O-R-D** was low in usage, maintaining a low cost, which might attract more players this round if they look for consistent results.

**Adjusting the Strategy**:
- Given the high costs on O-L-R-D with many players, it's likely there will be adjustments away from this route.
- The strategy could be to exploit the unchosen **O-L-D**, which might remain underutilized and affordable.
- **O-R-D**, while stable, might see increased interest, potentially leading to higher costs with more players.

Thus, considering the potential for fewer players and lower costs, choosing a historically underused route like **O-L-D** can optimize for lower travel expenses:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-L-R-D': 0, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Based on the outcomes from the last round, let's reevaluate the situation and make a strategic decision for the current round.

1. **Last Round Recap**:
   - **O-L-D**: 16 players
   - **O-L-R-D**: 0 players
   - **O-R-D**: 2 players
   - My payoff was 30, implying my total travel cost was 400 - 30 = 370.

2. **Cost Calculation for Each Route**:
   - **O-L-D**:
     - Cost = 10X + 210
     - With 16 players: Cost = 10(16) + 210 = 160 + 210 = 370. This means I chose **O-L-D**, as the calculated cost matches my expense.
   - **O-L-R-D**:
     - Not chosen last round, so there were no incurred costs on this route for players.
   - **O-R-D**:
     - Cost = 210 + 10Y
     - With 2 players: Cost = 210 + 10(2) = 230. This would have been a cheaper option.

3. **Strategic Consideration for This Round**:
   - The **O-L-D** route saw heavy usage, leading to significant costs. Players are likely to adjust away from it this round.
   - **O-L-R-D** was completely avoided, indicating a potential for low-cost usage since no players used it.
   - **O-R-D** saw minimal use, leading to lower costs and may attract more players due to its stable performance.

**Adjusting the Strategy**:
- Given the heavy congestion on O-L-D last round, it's probable that players will seek alternatives.
- The complete avoidance of **O-L-R-D** presents an opportunity, as it is less likely to be congested and may offer lower costs.
- While **O-R-D** has been cost-effective, it may attract more players this round, increasing costs.

Considering these factors, my strategic decision is to exploit the opportunity in the underused **O-L-R-D** route, which may offer a lower-cost travel option:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 0, 'O-L-R-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the results from the last round, let's analyze the data to make a strategic decision for the current round.

1. **Last Round Recap**:
   - **O-L-D**: 0 players
   - **O-L-R-D**: 16 players
   - **O-R-D**: 2 players
   - My payoff was 60, implying my total travel cost was 400 - 60 = 340.

2. **Cost Calculation for Each Route**:
   - **O-L-D**:
     - Not chosen, so no cost considerations were applied here for players.
   - **O-L-R-D**:
     - Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y
     - With 16 players on both O-L and R-D segments, Cost = 10(16) + 10(16) = 160 + 160 = 320. This closely matches my cost, implying this was my chosen route.
   - **O-R-D**:
     - Cost = 210 + 10Y
     - With 2 players: Cost = 210 + 10(2) = 230. This suggests that choosing this route would have been cheaper.

3. **Strategic Consideration for This Round**:
   - **O-L-D** continues to remain unchosen, potentially offering a lower-cost opportunity if players avoid it again.
   - **O-L-R-D** saw heavy usage and thus, higher costs due to congestion; players are likely to shift away this round.
   - **O-R-D** maintains low usage and could continue being a stable, low-cost choice unless player distribution shifts significantly.

**Adjusting the Strategy**:
- Given the congestion and high costs on O-L-R-D, it's reasonable to expect players to avoid the route this round.
- **O-L-D**, which hasn't been used for a couple of rounds, could represent a potentially underutilized path with lower costs.
- **O-R-D** remains attractive due to its historical low use and cost, though its predictability might increase use.

With these considerations, selecting a route that hasn't been popular and thus offers reduced congestion potential is the strategy, and my choice is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```
