System Message:

You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 10 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 10 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Round 1:
Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision on which route to choose, let's break down the possible options and their associated costs based on the number of drivers expected to choose each segment.

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - **Cost Calculation:** 10X + 210
   - The cost depends on the number of drivers X using segment O-L. The more drivers choosing O-L, the higher the cost.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - **Cost Calculation:** 10X + 0 + 10Y
   - The cost depends on the number of drivers X using segment O-L and the number Y using segment R-D. Costs increase with more drivers.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - **Cost Calculation:** 210 + 10Y
   - The cost is primarily dependent on the number of drivers Y using segment R-D.

**Strategy Analysis:**
- Choosing **O-L-D** can be costly if there are many drivers on segment O-L, but it avoids the uncertainty of segment R-D.
- Choosing **O-L-R-D** introduces potential high costs due to the dependence on both O-L and R-D segments, but might be less costly if fewer drivers choose these segments.
- Choosing **O-R-D** offers a fixed entry cost of 210 but can become costly with many drivers on segment R-D.

**Step-by-Step Decision Making:**
1. **Predict Driver Distribution:** Try to anticipate the distribution of drivers based on observed patterns from previous rounds (if available). 
2. **Minimize Shared Segment Use:** Prefer routes where you suspect fewer drivers will be present.
3. **Balance Fixed versus Variable Costs:** Consider whether accepting a fixed cost (e.g., route O-R-D) might result in lesser overall cost compared to others.

Given the lack of specific prior round data and assuming a desire to avoid the most crowded segment, I'll make an assumption that could often work when drivers are randomly distributed.

Choosing **O-L-R-D** might offer a balanced risk between using two potentially less crowded segments. However, if expecting high numbers on O-L and R-D based on similar driver behavior, consider alternatives.

**Decision:**
Given the hypothetical scenario without prior data on driver behavior, I'll choose **Route O-R-D** anticipating the initial fixed and potential uncertainty is less cost prohibitive compared to combining less certain segments like in O-L-D or O-L-R-D.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 2:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 20.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 1 agents
        O-L-R-D: 7 agents
        O-R-D: 10 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a well-informed decision in this round, let's analyze the situation based on the information from Round 1 and evaluate the potential outcomes of choosing each route.

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost: \(10X + 210\)
   - In Round 1, 1 agent chose this route. If the same distribution holds, \(X = 2\) (if I join), the cost would be \(10 \times 2 + 210 = 230\).
   - Payoff: \(400 - 230 = 170\).

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Cost: \(10X + 0 + 10Y\)
   - In Round 1, 7 agents chose this route. If I join, \(X = 8\) and \(Y = 10\).
   - Cost: \(10 \times 8 + 10 \times 10 = 180\).
   - Payoff: \(400 - 180 = 220\).

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost: \(210 + 10Y\)
   - In Round 1, 10 agents chose this route. If I join, \(Y = 11\).
   - Cost: \(210 + 10 \times 11 = 320\).
   - Payoff: \(400 - 320 = 80\).

Next, let's summarize and analyze:
- Choosing route O-L-D offers a potential payoff of 170.
- Choosing route O-L-R-D offers a potential payoff of 220.
- Choosing route O-R-D, which I previously chose, offers a potential payoff of 80.

Considering both the potential payoffs and attempting to anticipate potential shifts in other participants' behavior to maximize my payoff, choosing route O-L-R-D seems to offer the highest potential payoff based on last round's distribution.

Therefore, for this round, the best strategic choice appears to be route O-L-R-D.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 3:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 20.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 1 agents
        O-L-R-D: 7 agents
        O-R-D: 10 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-R-D and received a payoff of 170.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 11 agents
        O-L-R-D: 6 agents
        O-R-D: 0 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision on which route to choose for the next round, let's analyze the given data and available routes:

1. **Understanding Costs**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: Cost is \(10X + 210\), where \(X\) is the number of agents on segment O-L.
   - **Route O-L-R-D**: Cost is \(10X + 0 + 10Y\), where \(X\) is the number of agents on segment O-L and \(Y\) on segment R-D.
   - **Route O-R-D**: Cost is \(210 + 10Y\), where \(Y\) is the number of agents on segment R-D.

2. **Analyzing Previous Rounds**:
   - **Round 1**: You chose O-R-D and ended up on a highly congested route with 10 agents, leading to a high total cost and a low payoff.
   - **Round 2**: You switched to O-L-R-D, which had 6 agents, resulting in a lower total travel cost and a higher payoff than Round 1. Notably, Route O-R-D had 0 agents in Round 2, indicating significantly reduced congestion on segment R-D.

3. **Strategy for Next Round**:
   - The goal is to minimize cost. Segment congestion has a major influence on the overall cost. 
   - Observations suggest that agents moved from routes with higher congestion to less congested routes in Round 2.
   - Considering the improvement in payoff when congestion decreased on segment R-D, there may be an opportunity again on Route O-R-D if others continue to find alternatives.
   - Alternatively, Route O-L-R-D gave a reasonable payoff when 6 agents shared segments O-L and R-D in Round 2. If congestion remains low, it might deliver a solid payoff again.

4. **Deciding the Route**:
   - Based on the previous pattern where agents drastically reduced on Route O-R-D in Round 2, O-R-D might be expected to have low or manageable congestion again.
   - Sticking with Route O-L-R-D can be another conservative approach as it provided a decent payoff previously, even with moderate congestion on both shared segments.

Given this analysis, I will choose **Route O-L-R-D** for the next round as it balances potential congestion across both decision nodes with possibilities for a reasonable payoff.

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 4:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 20.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 1 agents
        O-L-R-D: 7 agents
        O-R-D: 10 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-R-D and received a payoff of 170.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 11 agents

- You chose route O-L-R-D and received a payoff of 100.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 0 agents
        O-L-R-D: 12 agents
        O-R-D: 6 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make the best decision for the next round, let's analyze the previous rounds and consider the potential choices. The goal is to maximize our payoff by minimizing travel costs.

### Review of Previous Rounds:

- **Round 1:**
  - Chose route: O-R-D
  - Payoff: 20
  - Agents distribution: O-L-D: 1, O-L-R-D: 7, O-R-D: 10
  - Cost calculation for O-R-D: \(210 + 10 \times 10 = 210 + 100 = 310\)

- **Round 2:**
  - Chose route: O-L-R-D
  - Payoff: 170
  - Agents distribution: O-L-D: 11, O-L-R-D: 6, O-R-D: 0
  - Cost calculation for O-L-R-D: \(10 \times 6 + 0 + 10 \times 0 = 60 + 0 + 0 = 60\)

- **Round 3:**
  - Chose route: O-L-R-D
  - Payoff: 100
  - Agents distribution: O-L-D: 0, O-L-R-D: 12, O-R-D: 6
  - Cost calculation for O-L-R-D: \(10 \times 12 + 0 + 10 \times 6 = 120 + 0 + 60 = 180\)

### Analysis:

- **Route O-L-D**: Often fewer agents choose this route, but has a high cost if more agents start choosing it due to the 10X cost on both segments.
- **Route O-L-R-D**: The payoff has been relatively good when fewer agents are on it. It is beneficial when the segment R-D is only lightly used as it didn't add any cost in Round 2 and was manageable in Round 3.
- **Route O-R-D**: Generally expensive when more agents choose it because the cost of the segment R-D increases quickly with more agents.

### Decision Breakdown:

1. **Route O-L-D**: Currently not ideal due to potential high variability in cost if agent numbers increase on either O-L or R-D segments. It can be very expensive if more than a couple of agents choose it.
2. **Route O-L-R-D**: This route remains promising as it circumvents high R-D costs when lesser agents choose O-L. Provided fewer agents continue to avoid R-D, as in Round 2, it results in a lower cost. However, it can be risky if many start using both segments.
3. **Route O-R-D**: Historically results in high costs due to heavy usage of R-D segment, leading to low payoffs.

Given the progression in previous rounds:

- **Round 1 was crowded on O-R-D resulting in low payoff**.
- **Round 2 had no agents on R-D thus optimal for O-L-R-D**.
- **Round 3 got congested on O-L-R-D, decreasing its payoff substantially**.

### Conclusion:
The route **O-L-R-D** seems like a balanced choice because it tends to yield moderate payoffs unless overly used, making it the most predictable in terms of maintaining a lower cost trend compared to the others if fewer agents choose it.

### Decision:
Given this analysis, I will choose route **O-L-R-D** in the next round, hoping not too many agents will make the same choice, to keep costs manageable and payoff higher.

Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 20.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make the best decision for Round 5, we should analyze the results from the previous rounds and use that information to predict how other participants might behave and select the least costly route accordingly.

1. **Understanding Cost Calculation**:
   - For route 'O-L-D': The cost is \(10X + 210\), where \(X\) represents the number of agents choosing 'O-L-D' or 'O-L-R-D' (as they both share the segment O-L).
   - For route 'O-L-R-D': The cost is \(10X + 0 + 10Y\), where \(X\) is the number of agents on O-L (sum of agents choosing 'O-L-D' and 'O-L-R-D') and \(Y\) is the number for R-D (sum of agents on 'O-L-R-D' and 'O-R-D').
   - For route 'O-R-D': The cost is \(210 + 10Y\), where \(Y\) is the number of agents on segment R-D.

2. **Analyzing Past Rounds**:
   - Round 1: High number (10) on 'O-R-D' leading to a high cost for that route. Majority were on 'O-L-R-D'.
   - Round 2: Most (11) went 'O-L-D' resulting in a low payoff for 'O-L-D' choosers. Few went 'O-L-R-D'.
   - Round 3: Majority again (12) on 'O-L-R-D', moderately low agents (6) on 'O-R-D' led to a manageable payoff.
   - Round 4: Split decision; a few went 'O-R-D', many stayed with 'O-L-R-D'.

3. **Predict Behavior for Round 5**:
   - Participants who experienced a high cost in previous rounds large on 'O-L-R-D' might explore switching to 'O-L-D' or 'O-R-D'.
   - Given the trend that many agents cycle between 'O-L-R-D' and 'O-R-D', it's probable they might reduce from 'O-L-R-D' to explore other routes this time.

4. **Choosing the Route**:
   Considering the above, reverting back to 'O-L-R-D' again might expose us to high costs as it's uncertain how many will remain on it. But looking at the previous cycles and assuming some will switch, expecting fewer than 9 might be reasonable.
   
   A potential payoff trade-off without too much risk is to try 'O-L-D' this time, anticipating the shift away from it could result in fewer on O-L, thus lowering the shared segment cost initially.

Thus, based on the above analysis and forecasting, it seems rational to choose the route 'O-L-D' for Round 5, hoping fewer participants select it, resulting in manageable costs and a potentially higher payoff.

Round 6:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 20.
- The number of agents on each route was:

        O-R-D: 4 agents

Round 5:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 70.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 4 agents
        O-L-R-D: 8 agents
        O-R-D: 6 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision for the next round, let's analyze the outcomes and costs associated with each route based on previous rounds.

1. **Understanding Costs**:
   - Route O-L-D: Cost = 10 * X (where X is number of drivers choosing O-L) + 210
   - Route O-L-R-D: Cost = 10 * X (for O-L segment) + 0 + 10 * Y (for R-D segment)
   - Route O-R-D: Cost = 210 + 10 * Y (where Y is number of drivers choosing R-D)

2. **Review Previous Rounds**:
   - Round 1: Route O-R-D was crowded (receiving a low payoff of 20).
   - Round 2: Achieved a reasonable payoff with route O-L-R-D (170 payoff, with no drivers on O-R-D).
   - Round 3: Route O-L-R-D became crowded (12 agents), leading to a reduced payoff of 100.
   - Round 4: Route O-L-R-D still had moderate traffic (9 agents), giving a payoff of 130.
   - Round 5: Switching to O-L-D resulted in a low payoff due to increased congestion on O-L (4 agents).

3. **Strategy for Next Round**:
   - **Route O-R-D** could potentially offer a high payoff, but only if it’s not crowded. It was not chosen in Round 2 and 3, offering a chance for lower costs.
   - **Route O-L-R-D** has been moderately successful when not overly crowded, but previous rounds show it's a popular choice.
   - **Route O-L-D** appears reliable when not many choose it; however, it has been crowded at times, as in Round 5.

Given the information, attempting to choose a route that spreads out traffic optimally is key to greater payoff.

**Decision**:
For the upcoming round, a potentially less crowded route that minimizes costs could be **O-R-D**, especially if others continue trends or switch off from their previous choices.

- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 1 agents
        O-L-R-D: 13 agents
        O-R-D: 4 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an optimal decision on which route to choose, let's analyze the travel costs and patterns from previous rounds step-by-step:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
    - The cost formula is `10X + 210`.
    - For lower values of X (number of drivers on O-L), this route becomes advantageous. 
    - In Round 5, with 4 drivers on O-L-D, this route cost you a payoff of 70 (indicating a cost of 330).
    - Trend: This route generally has fewer drivers, but it's important to monitor shifts.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
    - The cost formula is `10X + 0 + 10Y`, where X is the drivers on O-L and Y is the drivers on R-D.
    - When there are fewer drivers, this can be a good choice. However, it often results in higher competition.
    - Payoffs ranged from 100 to 170, with varying numbers of drivers utilizing it.
    - Trend: This route sees fluctuating driver numbers leading to varying costs.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
    - The cost formula is `210 + 10Y`.
    - With higher numbers on R-D, your cost increases significantly.
    - In Rounds 1 and 6, where you used this route, your payoff was quite low (20), indicating a very high cost.
    - Trend: This route often sees many drivers, leading to an increase in cost.

**Strategy:**
- To maximize the payoff, it’s advantageous to choose a route with lower expected number of drivers on dependent segments, especially O-L and R-D.
- Based on recent trends and the history provided:
  - Route O-R-D often sees many drivers, making it expensive.
  - Route O-L-D seems to have fewer drivers in many rounds, potentially offering a lower cost if this trend continues.
  - Route O-L-R-D offers variable costs; you need to anticipate fewer drivers for it to be optimal.

**Decision:**
Considering the past payoffs and the number of drivers on each route, I will choose:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

This choice is based on observing that Route O-L-D often had fewer drivers compared to others and could lead to a significant payoff if the trend continues.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision about which route to choose, let's analyze the past rounds and the payoffs received from each route selection:

1. **Route Analysis**:
   - **O-R-D**: This route provided very low payoffs (20 in rounds 1 and 6). It tends to attract a high number of drivers, as seen in rounds 1 and 6.
   - **O-L-R-D**: This route has provided varying payoffs, specifically higher payoffs in rounds 2 (170) and 4 (130), but also had a lower payoff in round 3 (100). This route can be a safer option when fewer agents choose O-R-D.
   - **O-L-D**: Low payoffs were observed in rounds 5 (70) and 7 (60). Only few drivers chose this route, leading to high travel costs on segment O-L.

2. **Driver Distribution**:
   - Participants frequently cluster on certain routes, but they also shift based on their previous experiences to optimize their payoffs.
   - Round 6 suggests a high risk for O-L-R-D due to 13 agents picking it, leading to high segment R-D costs.
   - Although O-R-D attracts a significant number of participants, its payoff is the lowest when heavily chosen.

3. **Strategy**:
   - Given the low payoff history and tendency of O-R-D to attract many drivers, I should avoid this route.
   - O-L-R-D performed best when fewer people chose O-R-D, minimizing costs on segment R-D.
   - O-L-D has been relatively less chosen but still led to low payoffs due to high cost on segment O-L.

4. **Decision for Round 8**:
   - With the fluctuating behavior of my opponents, it's strategic to anticipate fewer drivers might switch away from O-R-D after poor payoffs.
   - Considering the history, O-L-R-D seems to provide more stable and potentially higher payoffs if O-R-D remains an unattractive option for most.

**Conclusion**: For the next round, I would choose the route 'O-L-R-D' as it offers the best chance for a decent payoff based on prior rounds' analysis.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision on which route to choose for the next round, let's analyze the costs and payoffs of each route based on the data provided from previous rounds:

### Route Analysis:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost Formula: \(10X + 210\).
   - Payoffs: 
     - Round 1: NA
     - Round 5: Payoff 70 (4 agents on O-L-D)
     - Round 7: Payoff 60 (5 agents on O-L-D)
   - Generally low payoff, indicating relatively high costs, potentially because the number of agents on O-L (segment O-L) increases the cost significantly.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Cost Formula: \(10X + 0 + 10Y\).
   - Payoffs:
     - Round 2: Payoff 170 (6 agents on O-L-R-D, 0 agents on O-R-D)
     - Round 3: Payoff 100 (12 agents on O-L-R-D, 6 agents on O-R-D)
     - Round 4: Payoff 130 (9 agents on O-L-R-D, 4 agents on O-R-D)
     - Round 8: Payoff 90 (13 agents on O-L-R-D, 4 agents on O-R-D)
   - The most consistent route in terms of payoffs. However, payoffs decrease significantly as the number of agents on O-L-R-D increases.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost Formula: \(210 + 10Y\).
   - Payoffs:
     - Round 1: Payoff 20 (10 agents on O-R-D)
     - Round 6: Payoff 20 (4 agents on O-R-D)
   - The low payoffs suggest high costs even with relatively few agents, largely due to the fixed cost of segment O-R (210) and possibly high agent count on R-D.

### Decision-Making:

1. Payoff is maximized when either the route chosen has fewer agents (i.e., less congestion) or inherently lower costs.
2. Currently, both routes O-L-D and O-R-D seem to result in consistently lower payoffs than O-L-R-D despite the number of agents.
3. Based on previous rounds, O-L-R-D provided the highest payoff when few agents chose O-R-D or when the congestion on O-L-R-D was manageable (around 6 to 9 agents).

### Strategy:

For the next round, considering the calculation of previous payoffs, **choosing route O-L-R-D** again seems to be the best decision to potentially achieve a middle-ground payoff, especially aimed to leverage any reduction in agents on the route or excessive loads on alternative routes.

Here is the final decision in JSON format:

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision about which route to choose in Round 10, let's analyze the results from the previous rounds.

1. **Payoffs Analysis**:
    - The goal is to maximize the payoff, equivalent to minimizing the cost incurred from the route chosen.
    - Highest payoffs were seen with routes "O-L-R-D" and "O-L-D". The choice "O-R-D" consistently resulted in very low payoffs.

2. **Route Pattern**:
    - Route "O-L-R-D": It provided reasonable payoffs in Rounds 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9. It seems to have been a good option when the number of users was moderate to high.
    - Route "O-L-D": This route gave moderate payoffs in Rounds 5 and 7.
    - Route "O-R-D": Despite being chosen in Rounds 1 and 6, this route led to very low payoffs due to high participant counts, leading to high costs.

3. **Participant Distribution**:
    - In Rounds where "O-R-D" was chosen, it often had many participants, leading to high costs on the R-D segment.
    - "O-L-R-D" seems to be favored when the O-R-D route is less popular, which in turn reduces costs.
    - Choosing "O-L-D" might be advantageous when you predict fewer people on that route, reducing the O-L segment cost.

4. **Strategy**:
    - Avoid "O-R-D" given its track record of low payoffs.
    - Consider "O-L-R-D" or "O-L-D" based on how participant numbers might shift. Given that "O-L-R-D" has had higher consistency in providing moderate payoffs across various participant distributions, it might be wise to choose it, especially considering its strategic flexibility.

5. **Decision**:
Based on the above analysis, I suggest choosing "O-L-R-D" for Round 10. It has shown the capacity to yield reasonable payoffs across different participant distributions.
