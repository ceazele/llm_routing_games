System Message:

You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 10 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 10 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Round 1:
Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision, let's evaluate each route by considering potential travel costs and strategies:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost: 10X + 210
   - X represents the number of drivers choosing this route. This route's cost is highest when many travelers choose segment O-L.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Cost: 10X + 0 + 10Y
   - X is as defined above, and Y represents the number of drivers that choose segment R-D. This route benefits from fewer drivers choosing segments O-L and R-D, as its cost derives from both.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost: 210 + 10Y
   - Here, the cost heavily depends on the number of drivers choosing segment R-D, indicated by Y. Fixed cost for segment O-R makes this appealing if segment R-D is less congested.

**Strategic Considerations:**
- **Balancing Load:** Ideally, picking the least congested segments reduces costs. Understanding typical traffic patterns from previous rounds would aid in prediction.
- **Risk and Reward:** Routes with variable costs (O-L-D and O-R-D) have potential for higher savings but also higher costs.

**Decision:**
Given all participants aim to minimize cost, shifts in preference can cause overcrowding on a previously optimal route. Therefore, selection hinges on predicting others' choices. For a first round, absent historical data, O-L-R-D provides balance by diversifying cost factors, potentially minimizing risk if either segment O-L or R-D is moderately congested rather than heavily.

Based on the evaluation, I will choose the route "O-L-R-D".

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 2:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-L-R-D and received a payoff of 150.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 1 agents
        O-L-R-D: 7 agents
        O-R-D: 10 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a strategic decision on which route to choose in the next round, let's analyze the information and outcomes from the previous round. Our goal is to minimize travel costs and maximize payoff. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Understand the Costs for Each Route:**
    - **Route O-L-D:** Cost is `10X + 210` where X is the number of agents on O-L segment.
    - **Route O-L-R-D:** Cost is `10X + 0 + 10Y` where X is the number of agents on O-L, and Y is the number of agents on R-D.
    - **Route O-R-D:** Cost is `210 + 10Y` where Y is the number of agents on R-D.

2. **Round 1 Analysis:**
    - **O-L-R-D:** We chose this route. If we received a payoff of 150, our cost must have been 250 (`400 - 150`). Since costs on O-L and R-D were 10X and 10Y respectively, the calculations match:
        - Segment O-L: 10X = 8 × 10 = 80 (since 7 others + me were on O-L)
        - Segment R-D: 10Y = 10 × 10 = 100 (since 10 others + me were on R-D)
        - Total cost: 80 + 100 = 180 + fixed 0 = 180 (misalignment here since end calculation showed 250 probably due to incorrect variable mentions, assumed fixed cost mislead)
    - **O-R-D:** It had 10 agents. Cost here is `210 + 10×10 = 310`.
    - **O-L-D:** Had 1 agent. Cost was `10×8 + 210 = 290`.

3. **Strategic Consideration:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** Has potential for low cost if fewer agents choose it.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** Previously chosen, had moderate cost. Costs split on two traffic-dependent segments.
   - **Route O-R-D:** Had high agent concentration; likely to incur higher costs.

4. **Plan for the Next Round:**
   - Given the previous round, route **O-L-R-D** had been a better choice comparatively based on believed cost, yet impact needs recalibration as original perceived costs mismatch revealed higher unassumed lead cost.
   - Now, considering strategy adjustment: If we anticipate shifts in choices leading to a relieved path on O-L-D due to deterrence, shifting to **O-L-D** might be worthwhile if fewer join. Risk here is ensuring minimal gain of user concenration else costs escalate.

Given these considerations and assuming strategic shifts across groups, let's select:

**Route Selection:** O-L-D.

Reflecting calculated estimation of potential cost and judicious presumption of reduced competition intercurrent based on generalized imitation-deterring strategy.

Round 3:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-L-R-D and received a payoff of 150.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 1 agents
        O-L-R-D: 7 agents
        O-R-D: 10 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route Invalid and received a payoff of 0.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 11 agents
        O-L-R-D: 6 agents
        O-R-D: 0 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide on a route for the next round, let's analyze the scenarios based on the past data and route characteristics:

1. **Routes Overview:**
   - **O-L-D**: Cost = \(10X + 210\), where X is the number of drivers on O-L.
   - **O-L-R-D**: Cost = \(10X + 0 + 10Y\), where X is the number of drivers on O-L and Y is the number of drivers on R-D.
   - **O-R-D**: Cost = \(210 + 10Y\), where Y is the number of drivers on R-D.

2. **Review of Previous Rounds:**
   - **Round 1:**
     - I chose O-L-R-D with a payoff of 150.
     - Distribution: O-L-D: 1, O-L-R-D: 7, O-R-D: 10
     - Total Costs: \(10 \times 8 + 0 + 10 \times 17 = 180\)
     - The most popular route was O-R-D with 10 agents.

   - **Round 2:**
     - I chose an invalid route accidentally.
     - Distribution: O-L-D: 11, O-L-R-D: 6, O-R-D: 0
     - The most popular route was O-L-D with 11 agents.

3. **Cost Impacts:**
   - For **O-L-D**: High cost if many agents use it due to the variable cost on O-L segment.
   - For **O-L-R-D**: Costs are variable on both O-L and R-D. Suitable if both segments are less crowded.
   - For **O-R-D**: Constant cost on the O-R segment and variable on R-D, appealing if R-D is not crowded.

4. **Optimization Strategy:**
   - Considering the unpredictability in numbers of agents on each segment, a strategy might be to aim for a balanced route that won't be crowded.
   - Based on prior rounds, O-L-R-D seems to have less variance when unpopulated on O-R-D.

5. **Choice for Next Turn:**
   - After evaluating past data and typical behavior, choosing **O-L-R-D** might again provide a good balance between potentially lower crowded segments.
   
Therefore, for the next round, I'm selecting the route **O-L-R-D**. 

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 4:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-L-R-D and received a payoff of 150.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 1 agents
        O-L-R-D: 7 agents
        O-R-D: 10 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route Invalid and received a payoff of 0.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 11 agents
        O-L-R-D: 6 agents
        O-R-D: 0 agents

Round 3:
- You chose route O-L-R-D and received a payoff of 100.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 0 agents
        O-L-R-D: 12 agents
        O-R-D: 6 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide on the best route for the next round, I'll analyze the summary of the previous rounds:

### Analysis:
- **Round 1:**
  - Route Chosen: O-L-R-D
  - Payoff: 150
  - Distribution:
    - O-L-D: 1 agent
    - O-L-R-D: 7 agents
    - O-R-D: 10 agents
  - The cost for O-L-R-D was calculated as follows: \( (10 \times 8) + 0 + (10 \times 10) = 180 \). Endowment - Cost = \( 400 - 180 = 220 \), but the payoff was given as 150, suggesting perhaps there was a correction in other drivers' costs or an oversight.

- **Round 2:**
  - Route Chosen: Invalid
  - Payoff: 0
  - Distribution:
    - O-L-D: 11 agents
    - O-L-R-D: 6 agents
    - O-R-D: 0 agents
  - I assume my choice resulted in no travel and, therefore, a payoff of zero. The high number on O-L-D likely led to high costs for the agents on that route.

- **Round 3:**
  - Route Chosen: O-L-R-D
  - Payoff: 100
  - Distribution:
    - O-L-D: 0 agents
    - O-L-R-D: 12 agents
    - O-R-D: 6 agents
  - The cost for O-L-R-D was \( (10 \times 12) + 0 + (10 \times 6) = 180 \). Endowment - Cost = \( 400 - 180 = 220 \), but the payoff was given as 100, indicating more complexity in driver interactions or costs.

### Strategy for Next Round:
- Going with the same route repeatedly when it accumulates many drivers tends to lower payoffs due to increasing costs.
- O-R-D results in a high fixed cost (210), but the additional segment cost depends on the number of drivers. If fewer choose this, it can result in a feasible route.
- O-L-D depends heavily on the congestion of segment O-L.

Given the previous rounds, choosing a route with fewer participants can optimize the payoff by minimizing costs. The O-R-D route has not been chosen frequently in the last two rounds:

**Decision:**

I will choose the route **O-R-D** for the next round. This decision is based on the possibility of it being underutilized, which minimizes the total segment cost beyond the fixed cost.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 5:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-L-R-D and received a payoff of 150.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 1 agents
        O-L-R-D: 7 agents
        O-R-D: 10 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route Invalid and received a payoff of 0.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 11 agents
        O-L-R-D: 6 agents
        O-R-D: 0 agents

Round 3:
- You chose route O-L-R-D and received a payoff of 100.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 0 agents
        O-L-R-D: 12 agents
        O-R-D: 6 agents

Round 4:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 60.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 5 agents
        O-L-R-D: 9 agents
        O-R-D: 4 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a strategic decision for the next round, let's analyze the information from previous rounds and consider potential costs for each route choice. The aim is to choose a route that minimizes travel costs, maximizing our payoff.

1. **Understanding Cost Functions:**
   - Route O-L-D: Cost is \(10X + 210\)
   - Route O-L-R-D: Cost is \(10X + 0 + 10Y\)
   - Route O-R-D: Cost is \(210 + 10Y\)

2. **Review Previous Rounds:**
   - **Round 1:** Choosing O-L-R-D resulted in a lower segment cost due to the 7 agents on that route, resulting in a payoff of 150. 
   - **Round 2:** Invalid choice, no payoff.
   - **Round 3:** Choosing O-L-R-D resulted in high usage (12 agents) leading to only 100 points payoff.
   - **Round 4:** Choosing O-R-D with 4 agents resulted in a payoff of 60, indicating it can be costly if others use it heavily.

3. **Analysis of Agent Distribution and Trends:**
   - O-L-R-D has often been popular, which generally drives the cost up due to more agents using segment R-D.
   - O-R-D had minimal usage, particularly in Round 4, which suggests potential lower costs if usage remains low.
   - O-L-D's user count varies significantly, can be a risky choice if many agents start choosing it.

4. **Predictive Strategies Moving Forward:**
   - Avoid the heavily used route (O-L-R-D), as costs rise with increased agent use, based on past rounds.
   - Opt for O-R-D if few agents choose it (risk/reward strategy). It had fewer agents recently, which would lower segment costs if that trend continues.
   - Consider trying O-L-D if it remains unpopular as the exact cost would be \(210 + 10*X\).

5. **Decision:**
   - Given the continued popularity of O-L-R-D and recent trends, it might be strategic to test a different route with potentially less congested states.

**Route Selection:**
I will choose the route O-L-D as historically, it's been less used or varied, offering the potential for lower costs if the usage stays low. Thus, my choice for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 6:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-L-R-D and received a payoff of 150.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 1 agents
        O-L-R-D: 7 agents
        O-R-D: 10 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route Invalid and received a payoff of 0.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 11 agents
        O-L-R-D: 6 agents

- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 5 agents
        O-L-R-D: 9 agents
        O-R-D: 4 agents

Round 5:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 70.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 4 agents
        O-L-R-D: 8 agents
        O-R-D: 6 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide on the optimal route choice, let's review the data from previous rounds and evaluate the strategies based on expected costs.

### Overview of Costs
Each route has different costs dependent on the number of drivers:

- **Route 'O-L-D'**: Cost = 10X + 210
- **Route 'O-L-R-D'**: Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y
- **Route 'O-R-D'**: Cost = 210 + 10Y

### Analysis of Previous Rounds
- **Round 1:**
  - My choice: O-L-R-D, payoff: 150
  - Agent distribution: O-L-D: 1, O-L-R-D: 7, O-R-D: 10
  - This implies high congestion on O-L and R-D, hence significant costs.

- **Round 2:**
  - Attempted invalid decision, no outcome.

- **Round 3:**
  - My choice: O-L-R-D, payoff: 100
  - Agent distribution: O-L-D: 0, O-L-R-D: 12, O-R-D: 6
  - High congestion on O-L.

- **Round 4:**
  - My choice: O-R-D, payoff: 60
  - Agent distribution: O-L-D: 5, O-L-R-D: 9, O-R-D: 4
  - Least congestion on O-R-D led to marginally better payoff compared to congestion assumptions.

- **Round 5:**
  - My choice: O-L-D, payoff: 70
  - Agent distribution: O-L-D: 4, O-L-R-D: 8, O-R-D: 6
  - Moderate congestion across all routes.

### Decision Strategy
Given the variability in agent distribution and the significantly lower payoff in Round 4 when choosing O-R-D despite lower initial congestion, route optimization needs careful analysis of potential agent movement.

Choosing **Route O-L-D**:
- Assumes the least congestion balance from analyzed rounds.
- Often emerges with a more balanced agent distribution, specifically for routes not leading to O-R-D which was chosen by many in early rounds.

The decision thus is to select the route that has historically had balanced components in costing and reasonable expected agent distribution, maximizing potential payoff and minimizing costs.

        O-L-D: 1 agents
        O-L-R-D: 13 agents
        O-R-D: 4 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide on the best route for the upcoming round, we should analyze the previous round summaries and identify patterns in route selection and payoffs. This analysis will guide us to choose the route that minimizes costs and maximizes payoff.

Here's the breakdown of previous rounds:

1. **Round Analysis:**
    - **O-L-D:** 
      - Round 5 & 6 showed lower participation on this route. 
      - Payoffs in these rounds were 70 and 50 respectively, which indicates that traffic on O-L was not much, resulting in lower travel times.
    
    - **O-L-R-D:**
      - Consistently, a high number of agents chose this route in most rounds, especially visible in Round 3 where there were 12 agents.
      - Payoff fluctuated due to the varying number of agents, leading to moderate to low payoffs, as higher numbers increase the congestion on O-L and R-D.
    
    - **O-R-D:** 
      - Round 4 indicated some return to this route with 4 agents, yielding a payoff of 60.
      - Previously (Round 4) suggested less congestion which should have resulted in fewer costs from R to D.
  
2. **Strategy Moving Forward:**
    - To maximize the payoff, we should avoid heavily congested routes.
    - The scoring in Route O-L-D has been relatively more favorable/reasonable when fewer participants traveled it.
    - O-R-D might provide a more stable alternative with predictable outcomes compared to the volatility seen in the O-L-R-D route, provided not many participants switch back to it.

Given this analysis, the best decision would be to choose a route less favored in the previous round but with the potential for lower traffic and higher returns. Therefore, the optimal route selection would be **O-L-D** since it was relatively less congested in the last round, aimed at diversifying from the likely heavy traffic of participants attempting to avoid the previously high traffic options.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed choice for the next round, we'll analyze the outcomes and patterns from previous rounds.

1. **Past Performance:**
   - The most consistent and highest payoff routes for you were when relatively fewer agents chose the same path. For instance, in Round 1 on route O-L-R-D, you received a payoff of 150 with 7 agents including yourself.
   - Rounds where you chose the route O-L-D generally resulted in lower payoffs (Rounds 5, 6, and 7 with payoffs 70, 50, and 60, respectively), suggesting a tendency of higher congestion or less favorable conditions when you chose this route.

2. **Route Analysis:**
   - **O-L-D**: The payoff on this route fluctuates based on the number of agents with you. Higher congestion (more agents) leads to high travel costs.
   - **O-L-R-D**: When you’ve chosen this route, payoffs have been better when fewer people opted for it in the same round (as seen in Round 3). 
   - **O-R-D**: In Round 4, the payoff was lower because fewer agents chose this route; however, total travel costs depend less on the number of users since there's a fixed cost for O-R, meaning it can potentially be economical if the segment R-D isn't crowded.

3. **Strategy & Prediction:**
   - The pattern indicates that agents tend to crowd either O-L-D or O-L-R-D. The predictable congestion might offer a strategic opportunity to choose a less popular path.
   - Avoid choosing based on the most popular choices in previous rounds to manage congestion costs. 
   - Examine recent trends and think about how other drivers might react. If they perceive O-L-D to be costly, they may shift to O-L-R-D, opening up O-R-D as a better option.

4. **Decision:**
   - Given past results, O-R-D could have less congestion, as agents might lean towards routes they think others won’t choose. 
   - In round 4, when 4 agents chose O-R-D, it resulted in the lowest relative travel cost adjustment because fewer participants used the R-D leg.

Based on this information, the strategic choice for the next round is:
- Route: **O-R-D**

  "route": "O-R-D"

LLM Output:
To make a decision, we need to review the outcomes of the previous rounds and identify a strategy that maximizes the payoff.

1. **Assessing Past Rounds:**
    - Route 'O-L-D' provided the following payoffs:
      - Round 5: Payoff of 70 with 4 agents.
      - Round 6: Payoff of 50 with 1 agent.
      - Round 7: Payoff of 60 with 5 agents.
    - Route 'O-L-R-D' provided these payoffs:
      - Round 1: Payoff of 150 with 7 agents.
      - Round 3: Payoff of 100 with 12 agents.
    - Route 'O-R-D' provided these payoffs:
      - Round 4: Payoff of 60 with 4 agents.
      - Round 8: Payoff of 20 with 4 agents.

2. **Cost Analysis:**
    - For 'O-L-D': Costs vary with the number of agents on segment O-L.
    - For 'O-L-R-D': Costs vary based on total agents on segments O-L and R-D.
    - For 'O-R-D': Costs vary based on total agents on segment R-D.

3. **Preferred Past Outcome:** 
   - Best payoff was 150 in Round 1 using 'O-L-R-D'.

4. **Current Trend and Decision:**
    - Route 'O-R-D' has become crowded in previous rounds with a high chance of payoff reduction.
    - Route 'O-L-D' offered a consistent but moderate payoff.
    - 'O-L-R-D' is promising based on past outcomes, providing the highest payoff potential if the route is less crowded.

Considering these factors, selecting the route 'O-L-R-D' might offer a chance for a higher payoff since it previously resulted in the highest payoff when not overly crowded.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To choose the optimal route for the next round, I need to consider my past experiences and how different routes were affected by the number of agents choosing them. Here is a breakdown of the routes and their impact:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - High variance in payoff: Rounds 5 (payoff 70), 6 (payoff 50), 7 (payoff 60).
   - If fewer agents choose this route, it tends to be less costly.
   - Payoffs suggest that with around 4-5 agents, the payoff is somewhat middle-ground compared to others.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - In previous rounds with higher participation like rounds 3 and 9, I received a payoff of 100, making it somewhat consistent with high numbers but with lower payoffs when participation was moderate (round 1, payoff 150).
   - This option has cost implications on both O-L and R-D segments based on the number of participants. A route to consider if few are choosing O-L but it's popular generally.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Lowest payoff when fewer agents chose (round 8, payoff 20).
   - Potentially the highest cost of 350 if all choose O-R-D (round 2).

Based on conditions and behaviors from past rounds, the least traveled routes tend to bring lower costs frequently because segments like O-L and R-D are cost-dependent on participation numbers. Given that O-L-R-D provides a middle-ground payoff in previous rounds, it's a balanced consideration when I'm unsure of how others will act.

**Decision:**

To maximize my payoff, I should aim for a route that might be less chosen or with manageable sharing. Given dynamics of prior rounds, I will choose:

```json
{
  "route": "O-L-R-D"
}
``` 

This choice considers that previous instances gave a decent payoff when very few chose O-R-D, and it balances between being not the most costly but offering less variability than others.
