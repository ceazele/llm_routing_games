System Message:

You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 10 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 10 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Round 1:
Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision, let's analyze the potential costs of each route based on hypothetical scenarios and the information provided:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost = 10X (where X is the number of drivers on O-L) + 210 (fixed cost on L-D).
   - This route could potentially have a high initial cost if many drivers choose O-L, since the cost is 10X.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Cost = 10X (number of drivers on O-L) + 0 (no cost on L-R) + 10Y (number of drivers on R-D).
   - This route could be beneficial if fewer drivers choose O-L or if there are already many drivers on R-D from those choosing O-R-D, since you'd share the R-D segment cost with them.
   
3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost = 210 (fixed cost on O-R) + 10Y (number of drivers on R-D).
   - This route guarantees a fixed cost on O-R, but the cost on R-D increases with more drivers.

Now, let's consider strategic factors:
- **Risk and Strategy:**
  - If I assume others will avoid O-R-D to minimize costs, it could become advantageous if fewer drivers choose it, leading to lower costs on R-D.
  - If I assume O-L is less crowded, O-L-D could be a lower-cost option.
  - O-L-R-D might offer a balance if drivers are evenly spread and I share the R-D cost over many drivers.

Given these analyses, the strategy should factor in both predictable driver behavior and cost minimization. Balancing between not following obvious choices which others might pick and not ending up on an overly crowded segment is key.

In absence of specific driver distribution data, a conservative initial choice could be to select the **O-L-R-D** route. This selection allows the flexibility of potentially lower shared costs across segments, assuming a median distribution across routes. Thus, I choose the route that diversifies the variable costs across segments:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Round 2:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-L-R-D and received a payoff of 150.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 1 agents
        O-L-R-D: 7 agents
        O-R-D: 10 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
Let's analyze the situation based on the provided information.

### Current Situation:
- **Your Payoff for Round 1**: 150 points.
- **Number of Agents on Each Route**:
  - Route O-L-D: 1 agent.
  - Route O-L-R-D: 7 agents.
  - Route O-R-D: 10 agents.

### Calculation of Costs for Each Route:
1. **Route O-L-D**:
   - Segment Costs: O-L costs 10 * (1+7+1) = 10 * 9 = 90.
   - L-D has a fixed cost of 210.
   - Total Cost: 90 + 210 = 300.
   - Payoff: 400 (endowment) - 300 (cost) = 100.

2. **Route O-L-R-D** (Chosen in Round 1):
   - Segment Costs: O-L costs 10 * (1+7) = 10 * 8 = 80.
   - L-R has a fixed cost of 0.
   - R-D costs 10 * (10+7) = 10 * 17 = 170.
   - Total Cost: 80 + 0 + 170 = 250.
   - Payoff: 400 - 250 = 150.

3. **Route O-R-D**:
   - Segment Costs: O-R has a fixed cost of 210.
   - R-D costs 10 * (10+8) = 10 * 18 = 180.
   - Total Cost: 210 + 180 = 390.
   - Payoff: 400 - 390 = 10.

### Conclusion:
- The route O-L-R-D provided you with a payoff of 150, which was higher than the potential payoff if you had chosen O-R-D.
- O-L-D has the least traffic so far, with only one agent, and thus offers a moderate potential payoff.

Considering the strategy moving forward, picking a less crowded route such as O-L-D with a payoff of 100 (based on predictions) could spread the traffic from O-L-R-D, possibly increasing future payoffs. However, given Round 1’s data, O-L-R-D offers a moderate maximum payoff path amid agent distribution.

### Decision:
Since multiple agents on O-L-R-D may redistribute themselves based on their received payoffs, attempting route O-L-D in this round might be beneficial while closely monitoring future outcomes and shifting strategies as needed.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 3:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-L-R-D and received a payoff of 150.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 1 agents
        O-L-R-D: 7 agents
        O-R-D: 10 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 20.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 11 agents
        O-L-R-D: 6 agents
        O-R-D: 0 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision on which route to choose in the upcoming round, let's analyze the data from the previous rounds and consider the potential costs associated with each route:

### Previous Rounds Analysis
1. **Round 1:**
   - Route selected: O-L-R-D
   - Payoff: 150 points
   - Costs:
     - Segment O-L: 10x7 = 70
     - Segment L-R: 0
     - Segment R-D: 10x10 = 100
     - Total Cost = 70 + 0 + 100 = 170
     - Payoff = 400 - 170 = 230 (This means there was an error in reporting the previous payoff)
   
2. **Round 2:**
   - Route selected: O-L-D
   - Payoff: 20 points
   - Costs:
     - Segment O-L: 10x11 = 110
     - Segment L-D: 210
     - Total Cost = 110 + 210 = 320
     - Payoff = 400 - 320 = 80 (Actual payoff, so previous data was reported incorrectly)
   
### Route Options Evaluation

1. **O-L-D:**
   - Segment O-L cost: Variable, dependent on the number of other drivers. In round 2, cost was high due to 11 drivers.
   - Segment L-D cost: Fixed at 210
   - Total cost trend: High if many drivers choose this route.

2. **O-L-R-D:**
   - Segment O-L cost: Variable
   - Segment L-R cost: Fixed at 0
   - Segment R-D cost: Variable. Previously 10 drivers, making it costly.
   - Total cost trend: Can be very high if many choose this route.

3. **O-R-D:**
   - Segment O-R cost: Fixed at 210
   - Segment R-D cost: Variable. Previously no drivers, which would minimize cost.
   - Total cost trend: Lowest if fewer competitors choose it.

### Strategic Decision

- **O-L-R-D** yields a medium cost due to 0 cost for segment L-R but requires careful consideration of segments O-L and R-D.
- **O-R-D** can minimize cost significantly if others overlook this route.
  
Given the higher cost of routes involving variable segments when populated and the fact that 'O-R-D' wasn't utilized in the previous round, choosing 'O-R-D' might likely result in a minimized cost due to the potential sole occupancy or fewer competitors.

### Decision
Based on the analysis, let's choose the route that has the potential for the lowest cost, which is 'O-R-D'.

```

Round 4:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-L-R-D and received a payoff of 150.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 1 agents
        O-L-R-D: 7 agents
        O-R-D: 10 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 20.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 11 agents
        O-L-R-D: 6 agents
        O-R-D: 0 agents

Round 3:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 0 agents
        O-L-R-D: 12 agents
        O-R-D: 6 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a strategic decision for the next round, let's analyze the outcomes of the previous rounds and try to predict the behavior of other participants. Here is a breakdown:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Routes chosen by others: O-L-D (1), O-L-R-D (7), O-R-D (10)
   - Your choice was O-L-R-D, resulting in a cost that left you with a payoff of 150.
   - O-R-D was the most popular choice; both segments O-L and R-D were quite congested.

2. **Round 2:**
   - Routes chosen by others: O-L-D (11), O-L-R-D (6), O-R-D (0)
   - You chose O-L-D when it was highly congested, leading to a low payoff of 20.
   - O-R-D was completely avoided, perhaps due to high costs in Round 1.

3. **Round 3:**
   - Routes chosen by others: O-L-D (0), O-L-R-D (12), O-R-D (6)
   - You chose O-R-D, which appeared less congested but still resulted in a low payoff of 10.
   - O-L-R-D again attracted many drivers, despite its congestion in Round 1.

**Analysis for Next Round:**
- O-R-D is risky due to typically higher costs even with moderate congestion, and it was crowded in Round 3.
- O-L-D can lead to large costs if many drivers choose it, as in Round 2.
- O-L-R-D has been chosen frequently, indicating it might be perceived as a safer or more balanced route despite moderate congestion.

**Decision Making:**
Given the historical data:
- O-L-R-D might balance risk, given its recurring moderate congestion and previous adequate payoff.
- Avoid O-R-D due to its historically high congestion costs.
- O-L-D could be an option if fewer agents are expected to choose it, but there's a risk of it becoming crowded again.

**Strategic Choice:**
Taking all factors into account, the route "O-L-R-D" appears to be the best strategic decision for the next round, aiming for a moderate payoff. It has historically provided a reasonable balance and is frequently chosen by others, perhaps indicating some expected stability in payoffs.

Round 5:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-L-R-D and received a payoff of 150.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 1 agents
        O-L-R-D: 7 agents
        O-R-D: 10 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 20.

        O-R-D: 6 agents

Round 4:
- You chose route O-L-R-D and received a payoff of 130.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 5 agents
        O-L-R-D: 9 agents
        O-R-D: 4 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision for the next round, let's break down the information from the previous rounds and assess the possible strategies:

1. **Understanding Payoffs and Costs:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** 
     - Costs = 10X (O-L) + 210
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** 
     - Costs = 10X (O-L) + 0 (L-R) + 10Y (R-D)
   - **Route O-R-D:** 
     - Costs = 210 (O-R) + 10Y (R-D)

2. **Evaluating Previous Rounds:**
   - **Round 1:**
     - Chose O-L-R-D: 7 agents, payoff = 150
     - Fewer agents on O-L-D but potential congestion in R-D
   
   - **Round 2:**
     - Chose O-L-D: 11 agents, payoff = 20
     - High number on O-L-D increased cost; O-R-D was unchosen
   
   - **Round 3:**
     - Chose O-R-D: 6 agents, payoff = 10
     - O-R-D was chosen by fewer agents, still not a high payoff due to congestion at R-D
   
   - **Round 4:**
     - Chose O-L-R-D: 9 agents, payoff = 130
     - Balanced choice led to better payoff

3. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - Routes with lower agent count on congestible segments tend to have better payoffs.
   - Avoiding highly populated routes can minimize costs.
   - Recent trends show fluctuation in choices and agent concentration.

4. **Decision Analysis for Next Round:**
   - O-L-D had a high number of drivers in Round 2 leading to low payoff. It can be costly if many choose it again.
   - O-L-R-D fluctuates but offers potential if congestion is balanced.
   - O-R-D was underused in early rounds but had better payoff than O-L-D when I chose it, except for R-D congestion.

5. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Choosing O-L-R-D might yield a balanced risk-reward if not many choose it (ideally fewer on O-L).
   - Monitor trends; be ready to adapt if unexpected high concentration on a segment is anticipated.

Based on the analysis, choosing **Route O-L-R-D** for the upcoming round could be optimal if R-D doesn't become overly congested again.

Round 6:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-L-R-D and received a payoff of 150.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 1 agents

        O-R-D: 6 agents

Round 4:
- You chose route O-L-R-D and received a payoff of 130.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 5 agents
        O-L-R-D: 9 agents
        O-R-D: 4 agents

Round 5:
- You chose route O-L-R-D and received a payoff of 140.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 4 agents
        O-L-R-D: 8 agents
        O-R-D: 6 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide on the optimal route for the next round, let's analyze the data from the previous rounds:

1. **Understanding Costs and Payoffs:**
   - **O-L-D:** The cost depends on how crowded the O-L segment gets because the L-D segment cost is constant at 210.
   - **O-L-R-D:** The cost depends on crowding in both O-L and R-D segments.
   - **O-R-D:** The cost depends solely on crowding in the R-D segment, provided the O-R cost is constant.

2. **Previous Rounds Observations:**
   - **Round 1:** O-L-R-D netted a decent payoff when there were balanced distributions on the routes.
   - **Round 2:** O-L-D resulted in the lowest payoff due to high crowding on the O-L segment.
   - **Round 3:** O-R-D had a low payoff due to high congestion on the R-D segment.
   - **Round 4 & 5:** O-L-R-D gave better payoffs with less crowding on the O-L segment.

3. **Strategic Consideration:**
   - **O-L-D:** Best if there are fewer drivers on both segments but the payoff in Round 2 suggests it’s risky if O-L gets crowded.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Has consistently given better payoffs especially when no extreme crowding exists on O-L.
   - **O-R-D:** Seems risky; high costs from R-D crowding make it less appealing unless few drivers choose it.

4. **Choosing a Route:**
   - Given the previous rounds, it seems that O-L-R-D provides a safe middle ground. It avoids the constant cost and risk on the O-R route and potentially balances the load between segments O-L and R-D.
   - The pattern from previous rounds suggests that participants often crowd either the direct route (O-L-D) or the shortcut (O-R-D), leaving the middle path (O-L-R-D) less congested.

**Decision:**
Choose the route O-L-R-D for the next round. This decision is based on balancing the risks from crowding and seeking a likely better payoff from reduced congestion through both segments.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a well-informed decision for the next round, let's analyze the trends and payoffs from the previous rounds:

1. **Evaluating Past Choices and Payoffs:**
   - **O-L-R-D** has been chosen in multiple rounds with variable outcomes:
     - Round 1: 150 payoff (7 agents on this route).
     - Round 4: 130 payoff (9 on this route).
     - Round 5: 140 payoff (8 on this route).
     - Round 6: 90 payoff (13 on this route).
   - **O-L-D** was chosen in Round 2 with a low payoff of 20 when 11 agents selected it.
   - **O-R-D** had a low payoff in Round 3 (10) with 6 agents.

2. **Identifying consistent patterns:**
   - **O-L-R-D** seems to offer relatively better payoffs in most cases, especially when fewer agents choose it (except Round 6).
   - **O-L-D** and **O-R-D** experienced lower payoffs when many agents chose those routes indicating possible congestion.

3. **Trends and strategic predictions:**
   - Agents generally tend to oscillate between routes, trying to find the least congested one.
   - **O-L-R-D** has shown competitive payoffs, albeit decreasing when more agents choose it. However, it's likely a pivot point for many participants.

4. **Decision-making approach:**
   - To minimize cost and maximize the payoff, selecting a route that avoids likely congestion is key.
   - **O-L-R-D** has shown relatively stable performance in non-extreme cases. 

Given these insights, an optimized strategy suggests selecting **O-L-R-D**, as it tends to yield better results when congestion is moderate. However, it will be essential to remain adaptable based on future observations.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide which route to choose, we need to analyze the outcomes from the previous rounds:

1. **Route Payoffs:**
   - Route O-L-R-D received varying payoffs: 150 (Rd 1), 130 (Rd 4), 140 (Rd 5), 90 (Rd 6), 140 (Rd 7).
   - Route O-L-D received a very low payoff: 20 (Rd 2).
   - Route O-R-D received a low payoff: 10 (Rd 3).

2. **Number of Participants on Each Route:**
   - Route O-L-D saw higher costs when there were many agents (Rd 2: 11 agents, cost high).
   - Route O-L-R-D is chosen most frequently, often staying around 8-13 agents.
   - Route O-R-D tends to have fewer agents and a high fixed cost, but when it does have agents, the payoff tends to be low (Rd 3).

3. **Cost Structure:**
   - O-L-R-D is risk management. It incurs a predictable cost from congestion at O-L and R-D, avoiding the higher fixed cost of O-L-D.
   - O-L-D is very risky due to a potential high number changing congestion.
   - O-R-D has high fixed costs which makes it less appealing.

4. **Strategy Moving Forward:**
   - Choosing route O-L-R-D has consistently provided better payoffs compared to the alternatives, except under high traffic, which has only occurred once (Rd 6).
   - Avoid O-L-D unless it's clear many are moving away from it.
   - O-R-D, while potentially less congested, inherently incurs high fixed costs regardless of the number of travelers, making it less appealing without a strategic reason to expect minimal congestion.

Given these points, I'd opt for route O-L-R-D again while monitoring congestion closely, as it has provided generally better outcomes despite variations.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision for the next round, let's analyze the data from previous rounds and identify patterns:

1. **Route Costs**:
   - **O-L-D:** The cost here grows with the number of agents on O-L due to the variable cost at O-L. The cost formula is \(10X + 210\), where \(X\) is the number of participants on O-L.
   - **O-L-R-D:** The cost is \(10X + 0 + 10Y\), where \(X\) is the number of participants on O-L and \(Y\) on R-D. This route might offer a balance when O-L segment usage is moderate, but can become costly if many people use it.
   - **O-R-D:** This has a relatively fixed cost of 210 at O-R and grows with the number of agents on R-D (\(210 + 10Y\)).

2. **Previous Rounds Analysis**:
   - Route O-L-R-D has been often chosen, but tends to vary in cost depending on the number of participants on each segment.
   - Route O-R-D was chosen in Round 3, where you had a low payoff, indicating that the number of participants on R-D was significant.
   - Route O-L-D was chosen in Round 2 with a very low payoff, due to max agents traversing O-L.
   - The best payoffs from using O-L-R-D occurred when its combined cost from segments O-L and R-D was minimized by having a moderate number of users.

3. **Trends**:
   - A trend shows the number of agents on each route fluctuates but tends to be high for O-L-R-D.
   - Often, O-L has fewer participants than R-D when considering O-R-D and O-L-D are used less frequently on average.

**Decision for the Next Round**:
Seeing that O-L-R-D has trends of moderate costs when relatively fewer participants use O-L and R-D together, especially from recent rounds, it could potentially offer a balanced path if we anticipate a moderate number of users. Additionally, O-L-R-D tends to provide a more consistent payoff when fewer participants are present in any segment.

However, historically taking this route has often led to moderate payoffs unless the participants balance well, implying there could be benefits trying another less frequently chosen route to avoid high common usage routes. O-R-D, though risky, might give a shot at a lower cost if others diverge.

Let's choose O-R-D for this round in the hope that since it was less used most recently, it may provide lower costs if only a few agents shift toward it.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an optimal decision for round 10, we need to analyze the patterns from previous rounds and assess how they might influence our next choice. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Current Observations:**
   - Route 'O-L-R-D' has generally provided a moderate payoff, sometimes higher than others (especially when the number of other agents on that route is less than 10).
   - Route 'O-R-D' showed a low payoff when it was overcrowded but could be beneficial when chosen by fewer agents.
   - Route 'O-L-D' offered the lowest payoffs when overcrowded and hasn't been chosen much in recent rounds.

2. **Calculation of Costs and Payoffs:**
   - For the O-L-D route, cost = \(10X + 210\). A higher number of drivers on O-L increases cost substantially. 
   - For the O-L-R-D route, cost = \(10X + 0 + 10Y = 10(X + Y)\). Generally, fewer agents chose both O-L and R-D segments simultaneously, making this route more consistent.
   - For the O-R-D route, cost = \(210 + 10Y\). Low Y can yield better payoffs.

3. **Analyzing Patterns:**
   - Rounds 6 and 8 had a high number of participants on the O-L-R-D route, resulting in a lower payoff.
   - When choosing O-R-D (Rounds 3 and 9), it didn't yield a good payoff, likely due to competition on segment R-D.
   - The transition from a low number of participants on O-L-D in earlier rounds showed an occasional opportunity for lower costs when fewer people predicted it.

4. **Prediction for Round 10:**
   - After evaluating participant distribution, if too many choose O-L-R-D, the payoff diminishes due to congestion.
   - Given prior tendencies, some participants might shift away from O-R-D and O-L-R-D due to previous failures in those rounds.
   - There's a slight chance that fewer participants might suddenly choose O-L-D, especially if they think it's been neglected.

5. **Strategic Decision:**
   - Based on previous rounds and aiming to exploit potential underestimation of the O-L route, choosing the O-L-D route might be beneficial if I anticipate a lower number of agents.

Given this analysis, the strategic decision is to choose the **O-L-R-D** route again, considering its previous consistent moderate payoffs and the distribution of other participants tending slightly towards less congestion in recent rounds. It balances risk and payoff potential better than the alternatives given current participant habits.
