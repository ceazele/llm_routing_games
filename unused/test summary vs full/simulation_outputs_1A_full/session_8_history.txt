System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 10 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 10 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a decision on which route to take, let's evaluate the potential costs for each route based on different scenarios. My goal is to minimize my travel costs, thereby maximizing my payoff.

1. **Understand the Cost Functions:**
   - Route O-L-D: Cost = \(10X + 210\), where \(X\) is the number of drivers on segment O-L.
   - Route O-R-D: Cost = \(210 + 10Y\), where \(Y\) is the number of drivers on segment R-D.

2. **Evaluate Initial Scenarios:**
   - **If nobody or very few people choose O-L-D:**
     - Cost is low due to \(X\) being small. Results in a total cost close to 210.
   - **If many choose O-L-D:**
     - Cost increases. With 9 people on O-L (half), cost is \(10 \times 9 + 210 = 300\).
   
3. **Evaluate Route O-R-D:**
   - **Fixed cost for segment O-R: 210.**
   - If nobody or very few people choose O-R-D, cost stays at 210.
   - If many choose O-R-D, cost increases due to more traffic on R-D.

4. **Consider Equilibrium:**
   - Ideally, participants will distribute themselves between routes to minimize individual discomfort (costs).
   - If more go to one path, cost increases, making the other path more attractive.

5. **Strategic Decision:**
   - Since both choices carry a fixed cost of 210 for one segment, the other segment's variable cost becomes crucial.
   - Starting with route O-R-D may offer a strategic advantage initially if others overestimate the initial load on O-L-D.

6. **Maximizing Payoff: (Based on game theory and initial assumptions)**
   - Assume equal distribution isn't achieved immediately — anticipate initial fluctuation.
   - **Start with O-R-D** as fewer people initially might choose a less 'obvious' choice, keeping costs potentially lower.

Given this breakdown and the expectation that the majority may initially lean towards the intuitively less costly route O-L-D until balances are sought, my strategic initial choice will be route O-R-D.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 7, 'O-R-D': 11}
Your payoff was 80

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the information from the last round, let's reassess the situation step-by-step to make an informed decision:

1. **Review Last Round's Costs:**
   - For O-L-D: 7 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost calculation: \(10 \times 7 + 210 = 280\)
   - For O-R-D: 11 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost calculation: \(210 + 10 \times 11 = 320\)
   - My choice was O-R-D, thus my cost was 320, leading to a payoff of \(400 - 320 = 80\).

2. **Analyze the Situation:**
   - Last round, O-L-D had a lower total cost (280) compared to O-R-D (320).
   - More players on O-R-D resulted in higher traffic and hence a higher cost.

3. **Prediction for This Round:**
   - Based on last round's outcomes, players currently on O-R-D may switch to O-L-D having observed lower costs there.
   - If more people switch to O-L-D this round, the costs could increase for O-L-D above 280.

4. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Considering players will likely adjust based on cost observations, there may be a re-balancing.
   - Assuming a switch by some from O-R-D to O-L-D, fewer drivers will be on O-R-D this round, potentially lowering its cost.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - I need to choose the route expected to have fewer drivers to minimize my personal cost.
   - Based on predicted behavior, it's reasonable to expect some players to switch from O-R-D to O-L-D, balancing the player distribution.

6. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Choose **O-L-D** this time as players from O-R-D may switch to equalize costs, potentially keeping costs at or below last round levels. However, I should remain flexible in future selections based on subsequent results.

Decision:
```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 13, 'O-R-D': 5}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the outcome of the last round, let's reassess the situation step-by-step to make an informed decision:

1. **Review Last Round's Costs:**
   - For O-L-D: 13 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost calculation: \(10 \times 13 + 210 = 340\)
   - For O-R-D: 5 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost calculation: \(210 + 10 \times 5 = 260\)
   - My choice was O-L-D, hence my cost was 340, leading to a payoff of \(400 - 340 = 60\).

2. **Analyze the Situation:**
   - O-R-D had a significantly lower cost last round compared to O-L-D.
   - Many more players chose O-L-D, resulting in higher congestion and hence a higher cost.

3. **Prediction for This Round:**
   - Players currently on O-L-D may reconsider their choice after observing the high cost, potentially switching to O-R-D.
   - As a result, the cost for O-R-D might still remain lower if it doesn't become overcrowded.

4. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Expect some rebalancing, where players will move from the more crowded O-L-D to the less crowded O-R-D.
   - By moving to O-R-D, I can potentially benefit if it remains underpopulated compared to O-L-D.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - The goal is to choose the route with fewer drivers to minimize my costs.
   - Anticipating the reaction and response of others, it is likely that I should choose the route that was less populated last round, i.e., O-R-D.

6. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Choose **O-R-D** this time as it was less congested last round, which led to lower costs, and participants from O-L-D may switch over after experiencing higher costs last round.

Decision:
```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the outcome of the last round, let's reassess the situation step-by-step to make an informed decision:

1. **Review Last Round's Costs:**
   - For O-L-D: 3 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost calculation: \(10 \times 3 + 210 = 240\)
   - For O-R-D: 15 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost calculation: \(210 + 10 \times 15 = 360\)
   - My choice was O-R-D, so my cost was 360, leading to a payoff of \(400 - 360 = 40\).

2. **Analyze the Situation:**
   - O-L-D had a significantly lower cost compared to O-R-D.
   - A large majority chose O-R-D, leading to higher congestion and cost.

3. **Prediction for This Round:**
   - Many players on O-R-D are likely to observe the high cost and might switch to O-L-D, anticipating lower costs.
   - As some players switch, this could balance the distribution and reduce the cost disparity.

4. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Given the feedback, it is reasonable to anticipate a shift where players migrate from O-R-D to O-L-D.
   - By choosing O-L-D, I can potentially benefit from it being less crowded than O-R-D this round if it doesn't get too crowded.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - My aim is to minimize my travel costs by picking the route with fewer drivers.
   - Given the dynamics, it makes sense to choose the route which was underutilized, i.e., O-L-D.

6. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Choose **O-L-D** this time as fewer players were on it last round, resulting in lower costs, and others may switch from O-R-D after experiencing high costs last round.

Decision:
```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 13, 'O-R-D': 5}
Your payoff was 60

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the outcome of the last round, let's reassess the situation and make a well-informed decision:

1. **Review Last Round's Costs:**
   - For O-L-D: 13 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost calculation: \(10 \times 13 + 210 = 340\)
   - For O-R-D: 5 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost calculation: \(210 + 10 \times 5 = 260\)
   - My choice was O-L-D, so my cost was 340, leading to a payoff of \(400 - 340 = 60\).

2. **Analyze the Situation:**
   - O-R-D had a lower cost compared to O-L-D last round.
   - A significant number of players chose O-L-D, which resulted in high congestion and higher costs.

3. **Prediction for This Round:**
   - Observing the high cost on O-L-D, many drivers may decide to switch to O-R-D.
   - This switch may potentially balance the distribution, causing O-R-D's cost to rise but still maintain lower than excessive overcrowding on O-L-D.

4. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Given last round's results, it is likely that more players will move from O-L-D to O-R-D to seek lower costs.
   - Opting for O-R-D could lead to reduced costs, especially if players try to distribute themselves more evenly between the routes.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - My goal is to minimize travel costs by selecting the route expected to have fewer drivers.
   - Based on previous outcomes and the likely behavior of other players, chosing the route that was less populated last round (O-R-D) may prove beneficial.

6. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Choose **O-R-D** this time as it had fewer players last round, resulting in lower costs, and others may consider switching following the high cost of O-L-D.

Decision:
```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 1, 'O-R-D': 17}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the outcome of the last round, let's reassess the situation step-by-step to make a well-informed decision:

1. **Review Last Round's Costs:**
   - For O-L-D: 1 driver chose this route.
     - Cost calculation: \(10 \times 1 + 210 = 220\)
   - For O-R-D: 17 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost calculation: \(210 + 10 \times 17 = 380\)
   - My choice was O-R-D, leading to a cost of 380 and thus a payoff of \(400 - 380 = 20\).

2. **Analyze the Situation:**
   - O-L-D had a significantly lower cost than O-R-D, as it was vastly underutilized.
   - A large majority picked O-R-D, resulting in high congestion and high costs.

3. **Prediction for This Round:**
   - Given the high cost for those on O-R-D last round, many are likely to reconsider and switch to O-L-D.
   - The goal is to anticipate a possible crowd shift towards O-L-D, which might begin crowding.

4. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Based on last round's costs, expect a significant shift from O-R-D to O-L-D due to a drastic difference in cost.
   - Choosing O-L-D may benefit as the route is likely to balance somewhat, but not enough to surpass the previous level of congestion of O-R-D.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - The aim is to pick the route expected to have minimal congestion for minimal costs.
   - Consideration indicates choosing O-L-D is beneficial as it had fewer drivers last round, assuring lower cost if not overly crowded.

6. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Choose **O-L-D** this time as it proved to be significantly less congested last round and offered a lower expense, and others may shift towards it from O-R-D.

Decision:
```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Analyzing the situation from the previous round, let's carefully consider the next steps:

1. **Review Last Round's Costs:**
   - For O-L-D: 16 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost calculation: \(10 \times 16 + 210 = 370\)
   - For O-R-D: 2 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost calculation: \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 230\)
   - My choice was O-L-D, leading to a cost of 370, which resulted in a payoff of \(400 - 370 = 30\).

2. **Analyze the Situation:**
   - A dominant number of players picked O-L-D, leading to higher congestion and, subsequently, high costs.
   - O-R-D had a significantly lower cost due to fewer participants.

3. **Prediction for This Round:**
   - Based on high costs on O-L-D, many players may now consider switching back to O-R-D for the upcoming round.
   - Anticipate a potential rebalance as players react to the previous high costs.

4. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Given last round's high costs on O-L-D, it's reasonable to expect some drivers to shift towards O-R-D.
   - Choosing O-R-D could offer lower costs if the number of participants remains manageable.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - The objective is to choose the route expected to have fewer players, minimizing congestion and costs.
   - Considering the potential switch of drivers back to O-R-D after high costs on O-L-D, I will choose O-R-D.

6. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Choose **O-R-D**, taking into account the predicted redistribution of participants and potentially lower congestion.

Decision:
```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

   - For O-R-D: 15 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost calculation: \(210 + 10 \times 15 = 360\)
   - My choice was O-R-D, resulting in a cost of 360, hence a payoff of \(400 - 360 = 40\).

2. **Analyze the Situation:**
   - O-L-D had a much lower cost compared to O-R-D.
   - A large number of players choosing O-R-D led to excessive congestion and high costs.

3. **Prediction for This Round:**
   - Observing the lower cost on O-L-D, many players might switch from O-R-D to O-L-D in the upcoming round.
   - This switch will likely lead to a more balanced distribution, potentially increasing costs on O-L-D but decreasing the number of players on O-R-D.

4. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Based on last round's lower costs for O-L-D, expect a shift of players from O-R-D to O-L-D.
   - Opting for O-L-D could yield a lower cost compared to the congested O-R-D.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - The goal is to minimize travel costs by selecting the route expected to have fewer drivers.
   - Given the potential movement of players towards O-L-D, yet also anticipating the potential overestimation by others, choosing O-L-D still presents favorable odds.

6. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Choose **O-L-D** due to its previous lower cost, and the likely adjustment where players leave the heavily congested O-R-D for O-L-D.

   - The goal is to anticipate this potential shift and adjust accordingly.

4. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - It is reasonable to expect some drivers to move from O-L-D to O-R-D to seek lower costs.
   - By switching to O-R-D, I can potentially benefit from it being less crowded.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - The aim is to choose the route with fewer drivers, thereby minimizing congestion and associated costs.
   - Given the likely response from players to the lower costs of O-R-D, I will choose O-R-D.

6. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Choose **O-R-D** this time as it had fewer drivers last round, leading to lower costs, and participants from O-L-D may switch due to the high cost last round.

Decision:

Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the situation based on last round's outcomes and decide on the best route for the next round:

1. **Review Last Round's Costs:**
   - For O-L-D: 4 drivers chose this route.
     - Cost calculation: \(10 \times 4 + 210 = 250\)
   - For O-R-D: 14 drivers chose this route.

2. **Analyze the Situation:**
   - O-L-D had a lower cost compared to O-R-D.
   - A significant number of players chose O-R-D, resulting in high congestion and higher costs.

3. **Prediction for This Round:**
   - Observing the lower cost on O-L-D, many players from O-R-D may consider switching to O-L-D this round.
   - Those on O-R-D may seek to decrease costs, leading to a potential shift in players.

4. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - If many players do switch from O-R-D to O-L-D, this could lead to more balanced route distribution or potentially overcrowd O-L-D.
   - Given that fewer players on O-L-D led to lower costs, it's a viable choice this round.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - The aim is to choose the route expected to have fewer drivers, thus keeping congestion and costs low.
   - Considering the recent outcome and the potential shift of players, choosing O-L-D could result in lower costs if more drivers leave O-R-D.

6. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Choose **O-L-D** expecting that some drivers will switch for lower costs, aiming for it to remain less congested compared to O-R-D.

Decision:
```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
