System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 10 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 10 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a well-informed decision on which route to choose in the traffic network game, let's break down the options and evaluate potential outcomes step by step.

1. **Understanding the Costs**:
   - Route 'O-L-D': The cost function here is (10 * X) + 210, where X is the number of drivers choosing this route.
   - Route 'O-R-D': The cost here is 210 + (10 * Y), where Y is the number of drivers choosing this route.

2. **Goal**: 
   - Minimize travel cost and maximize payoff.
   - Each round begins with 400 points. The payoff is this endowment minus the travel cost.

3. **Considerations**:
   - Both routes have a fixed component of 210.
   - The variable component depends on the number of drivers (X or Y) choosing the respective routes.

4. **Initial Strategy**:
   - Initially, I lack information on other drivers' choices. I'll assume they aim to minimize costs similarly.
   - A logical choice would be to alternate or stay with a less likely chosen route to avoid congestion.

5. **Decision Making**:
   - If most drivers choose a balanced split, costs may stabilize.
   - Since there's a high cost of 210 on each route irrespective of the variable component, I observe if one route tends to be less crowded initially.
   - I will choose route 'O-L-D' for my initial attempt, hypothesizing it might attract fewer drivers given its cost variation starting point until I gather more insights on collective behavior in subsequent rounds.

Therefore, based on these steps, my choice for the first round is route 'O-L-D' to evaluate its impact compared to the fixed cost route.

Let's format this decision according to the required JSON schema.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 7, 'O-R-D': 11}
Your payoff was 120

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To decide on the best route for the current round, I will analyze the outcomes from the last round and consider adjustments based on the data provided.

1. **Review Last Round's Outcome**:
   - Number of drivers on 'O-L-D': 7
   - Number of drivers on 'O-R-D': 11
   - My payoff was 120, which means my travel cost was 280 (as 400 - 280 = 120).

2. **Calculate Travel Costs from Last Round**:
   - For 'O-L-D': Cost = 10 * 7 + 210 = 280
   - For 'O-R-D': Cost = 210 + 10 * 11 = 320
   - In retrospect, 'O-L-D' resulted in a lower cost last round compared to what 'O-R-D' would have been.

3. **Analysis and Strategy**:
   - 'O-L-D' had fewer drivers than 'O-R-D', indicating a tendency for more players to choose 'O-R-D'.
   - Choosing 'O-L-D' appears beneficial if others continue favoring 'O-R-D'.

4. **Predictive Adjustments**:
   - Given more players on 'O-R-D', it's plausible some may switch to 'O-L-D' to reduce their costs.
   - However, 'O-L-D' being the less crowded option previously might still keep costs lower.

5. **Decision**:
   - To maximize payoff, I will need to anticipate the potential shift of some drivers from 'O-R-D' to 'O-L-D'.
   - I will risk choosing 'O-L-D' once more, as any shift may mildly raise the cost but likely not exceed the previous 'O-R-D' cost level unless the switch is drastic.

Hence, based on this calculated prediction and strategy:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 13, 'O-R-D': 5}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision for this round, I'll evaluate the situation based on the outcomes from the last round and adjust my strategy accordingly.

1. **Review Last Round's Outcome**:
   - Number of drivers on 'O-L-D': 13
   - Number of drivers on 'O-R-D': 5
   - My payoff was 60, meaning my travel cost was 340 (since 400 - 340 = 60).

2. **Calculate Travel Costs from Last Round**:
   - For 'O-L-D': Cost = 10 * 13 + 210 = 340
   - For 'O-R-D': Cost = 210 + 10 * 5 = 260
   - Last round, 'O-R-D' was significantly cheaper.

3. **Analyze Behavior Trends**:
   - A significant shift occurred with many drivers choosing 'O-L-D', increasing the cost substantially.
   - 'O-R-D' was underused and hence cheaper last round.

4. **Strategy and Prediction**:
   - The trend reveals that when one route gets crowded, the other becomes a better option.
   - Many participants may now realize 'O-R-D' was cheaper, leading them to switch back.

5. **Decision**:
   - Anticipate some drivers will switch to 'O-R-D' but not a majority.
   - I'll choose 'O-R-D' this time to potentially benefit from its lower cost last round, expecting that it might still be less crowded or at least balanced.

Given this strategic adjustment:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To decide on the best route for this round, let’s analyze the results from the last round and adjust our strategy accordingly.

1. **Review Last Round's Outcome**:
   - Number of drivers on 'O-L-D': 3
   - Number of drivers on 'O-R-D': 15
   - My payoff was 40, which means my travel cost was 360 (since 400 - 360 = 40).

2. **Calculate Travel Costs from Last Round**:
   - For 'O-L-D': Cost = 10 * 3 + 210 = 240
   - For 'O-R-D': Cost = 210 + 10 * 15 = 360
   - 'O-L-D' was significantly cheaper last round.

3. **Analyze Behavioral Trends**:
   - A dramatic shift occurred, with most drivers moving to 'O-R-D', leading to high costs.
   - 'O-L-D' was underutilized, making it a cost-effective choice.

4. **Strategy and Prediction**:
   - Players will likely realize 'O-L-D' was cheaper and may switch back in larger numbers.
   - However, changes based on last round data may take a round to equilibrate.

5. **Decision**:
   - Anticipate a potential shift to 'O-L-D', but it might remain less congested than 'O-R-D'.
   - I will choose 'O-L-D' this time, expecting the cost to remain lower or balanced, taking advantage of fewer than maximal potential switchers.

Based on these considerations, my choice for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 13, 'O-R-D': 5}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To decide on the optimal route for this round, let's evaluate the outcomes from the last round and adjust the strategy based on observed behaviors.

1. **Review Last Round's Outcome**:
   - Number of drivers on 'O-L-D': 13
   - Number of drivers on 'O-R-D': 5
   - My payoff was 60, which means my travel cost was 340 (since 400 - 340 = 60).

2. **Calculate Travel Costs from Last Round**:
   - For 'O-L-D': Cost = 10 * 13 + 210 = 340
   - For 'O-R-D': Cost = 210 + 10 * 5 = 260
   - 'O-R-D' was considerably cheaper last round.

3. **Analyze Behavior Trends**:
   - A significant number of drivers switched back to 'O-L-D', raising costs.
   - 'O-R-D' remained underutilized but offered a lower cost.

4. **Strategy and Prediction**:
   - Drivers may likely notice the lower costs of 'O-R-D' and could switch routes.
   - Predicting some movement back to 'O-R-D', considering many might still believe others will stay on 'O-L-D'.

5. **Decision**:
   - Since 'O-R-D' offered lower costs and may still remain underused, I anticipate fewer drivers will be on 'O-R-D'.
   - I'll choose 'O-R-D' to capitalize on its potential lower costs, hoping the shift isn’t massive but balances instead.

Based on this strategy, my choice for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 1, 'O-R-D': 17}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To decide on the best route for this round, I will analyze the situation from the last round and determine an appropriate strategy moving forward.

1. **Review Last Round's Outcome**:
   - Number of drivers on 'O-L-D': 1
   - Number of drivers on 'O-R-D': 17
   - My payoff was 20, which means my travel cost was 380 (as 400 - 380 = 20).

2. **Calculate Travel Costs from Last Round**:
   - For 'O-L-D': Cost = 10 * 1 + 210 = 220
   - For 'O-R-D': Cost = 210 + 10 * 17 = 380
   - 'O-L-D' was significantly cheaper last round.

3. **Analyze Behavior Trends**:
   - A dramatic imbalance occurred, with most drivers choosing 'O-R-D'.
   - 'O-L-D' was far less congested, making it highly cost-effective.

4. **Strategy and Prediction**:
   - Many drivers may recognize the cost advantage of 'O-L-D' and switch to it.
   - Predict a potential switch to 'O-L-D', but possibly still fewer than the maximal shift.

5. **Decision**:
   - I'll anticipate a shift towards 'O-L-D' since it offered lower costs last round.
   - However, even with some switching, it's reasonable to believe 'O-L-D' will remain cost-effective for this round compared to the overloaded state of 'O-R-D' last round.
   - I'll choose 'O-L-D' this round, expecting it to provide a balanced or lower cost than if I stayed on 'O-R-D'.

Given these strategic adjustments, my choice for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision for this round, let's consider the outcomes from the last round and adapt our approach based on observed behaviors.

1. **Review Last Round's Outcome**:
   - Number of drivers on 'O-L-D': 16
   - Number of drivers on 'O-R-D': 2
   - My payoff was 30, indicating a travel cost of 370 (as 400 - 370 = 30).

2. **Calculate Travel Costs from Last Round**:
   - For 'O-L-D': Cost = 10 * 16 + 210 = 370
   - For 'O-R-D': Cost = 210 + 10 * 2 = 230
   - 'O-R-D' was significantly cheaper last round.

3. **Analyze Behavior Trends**:
   - A large majority of drivers switched to 'O-L-D', causing high congestion and cost.
   - 'O-R-D' was minimally used and kept costs low.

4. **Strategy and Prediction**:
   - Drivers will likely realize the extreme higher cost of 'O-L-D' and a potential benefit in moving to 'O-R-D'.
   - Anticipating a shift towards 'O-R-D', but likely not all drivers will switch in one round.

5. **Decision**:
   - Given 'O-R-D' had minimal congestion and low costs, it is a strategic choice.
   - I expect that even with some drivers switching to 'O-R-D', it will likely remain less costly than 'O-L-D', which may still retain some congestion.

Based on these insights, my choice for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a strategic decision for the upcoming round, I will evaluate the results from the last round and formulate a plan.

1. **Review Last Round's Outcome**:
   - Number of drivers on 'O-L-D': 3
   - Number of drivers on 'O-R-D': 15
   - My payoff was 40, which means my travel cost was 360 (since 400 - 360 = 40).

2. **Calculate Travel Costs from Last Round**:
   - For 'O-L-D': Cost = 10 * 3 + 210 = 240
   - For 'O-R-D': Cost = 210 + 10 * 15 = 360
   - 'O-L-D' was significantly cheaper last round.

3. **Analyze Trends and Behavior**:
   - There was a major shift towards 'O-R-D', making it costly.
   - 'O-L-D' had minimal usage, keeping its costs much lower.

4. **Strategy and Prediction**:
   - It's highly probable participants will notice the lower cost of 'O-L-D' and some will switch back.
   - However, likely not all drivers will move immediately as such shifts can take more than one round to stabilize.

5. **Decision**:
   - Anticipate some switching to 'O-L-D', but given last round's cost disparity, it remains a preferable option.
   - 'O-L-D' still appears to be the strategic choice given its low usage and cost in the prior round.

Therefore, based on this reasoning, I will choose the route 'O-L-D' again, expecting that it's likely to still offer a lower cost condition even if a few drivers switch to it.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 13, 'O-R-D': 5}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To decide on the optimal route for this round, I'll walk through a detailed analysis of last round's outcomes and consider strategic implications.

1. **Review Last Round's Outcome**:
   - Number of drivers on 'O-L-D': 13
   - Number of drivers on 'O-R-D': 5
   - My payoff was 60, which indicates my travel cost was 340 (since 400 - 340 = 60).

2. **Calculate Travel Costs from Last Round**:
   - For 'O-L-D': Cost = 10 * 13 + 210 = 340
   - For 'O-R-D': Cost = 210 + 10 * 5 = 260
   - 'O-R-D' was considerably cheaper last round.

3. **Analyze Behavioral Trends**:
   - A significant number of drivers moved to 'O-L-D', increasing cost.
   - 'O-R-D' remained relatively underutilized, thus offering lower travel costs.

4. **Strategic Prediction**:
   - Drivers are likely to notice the reduced cost of 'O-R-D' and may switch to it.
   - The switch may not be massive in one round but enough to make 'O-R-D' a more attractive option.

5. **Decision**:
   - Opting for 'O-R-D' seems strategically beneficial, as the potential risk of congestion shift should still render it less costly.
   - Based on previous rounds, expecting some balance but not excessive switching could keep 'O-R-D' advantageous.

Taking these considerations into account, my choice for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 4, 'O-R-D': 14}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision for the current round, let’s analyze the prior round results and adjust the strategy accordingly.

1. **Review Last Round's Outcome**:
   - Number of drivers on 'O-L-D': 4
   - Number of drivers on 'O-R-D': 14
   - My payoff was 50, which indicates my travel cost was 350 (since 400 - 350 = 50).

2. **Calculate Travel Costs from Last Round**:
   - For 'O-L-D': Cost = 10 * 4 + 210 = 250
   - For 'O-R-D': Cost = 210 + 10 * 14 = 350
   - 'O-L-D' was significantly cheaper than 'O-R-D' last round.

3. **Analyze Behavioral Trends**:
   - A large number of drivers crowded onto 'O-R-D', resulting in higher costs.
   - 'O-L-D' had relatively low traffic, making it a more cost-effective option.

4. **Strategic Prediction**:
   - It's probable that drivers will notice the lower cost for 'O-L-D' and switch to it.
   - However, not all drivers may switch immediately, as changes often take more than one round to fully equilibrate.

5. **Decision**:
   - While 'O-L-D' may see an increase in drivers, it still potentially offers a lower cost due to its current underutilization.
   - I will choose 'O-L-D' this round, expecting that it will remain a strategic option and likely offer better payoffs, even if it becomes slightly more congested.

Based on this step-by-step analysis, my choice for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```
