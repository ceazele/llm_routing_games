System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 10 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 10 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a decision on which route to choose, let's analyze the given traffic network game and calculate potential costs for each route.

1. **Understanding the Cost Functions:**
   - Route 'O-L-D': The cost is \( 10X + 210 \), where \( X \) is the number of drivers choosing 'O-L-D'.
   - Route 'O-R-D': The cost is \( 210 + 10Y \), where \( Y \) is the number of drivers choosing 'O-R-D'.

2. **Goal:**
   - Minimize costs to maximize payoff.
   - Initial endowment is 400 points. Payoff = 400 - travel cost.

3. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - If most drivers choose the same route, the cost for that route will increase.
   - Choosing a less crowded route would generally result in lower costs.

4. **Deciding the Optimal Route:**
   - In the first round, without historical data, an initial assumption can be made based on symmetry and strategy:
     - Predict that other drivers may favor one over the other initially.
     - Given identical fixed costs (210) but variable costs based on others’ choices, the optimal initial strategy could involve choosing a balanced approach.

5. **Reasoning Approach:**
   - If assuming even split (9 drivers on each route):
     - Cost for 'O-L-D': \( 10 \times 9 + 210 = 90 + 210 = 300 \)
     - Cost for 'O-R-D': \( 210 + 10 \times 9 = 210 + 90 = 300 \)
   - Both are equal at this distribution.

6. **Decision: Select Based on Strategic Advantage:**
   - Choose 'O-L-D' because if fewer people choose it, it potentially lowers the cost more than evenly assumed (more players tend to avoid variable costs initially).

Based on the analysis above, the route chosen for the initial round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 7, 'O-R-D': 11}
Your payoff was 120

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the situation with the provided information from the last round.

1. **Last Round Outcome:**
   - Route 'O-L-D': 7 players
   - Route 'O-R-D': 11 players
   - Your payoff: 120
   
   This means that last round, the cost for 'O-L-D' was \( 10 \times 7 + 210 = 70 + 210 = 280 \), resulting in a payoff of \( 400 - 280 = 120 \).

   Hence, you chose 'O-L-D' last round.

2. **Cost Calculation for 'O-R-D' Last Round:**
   - The cost would have been \( 210 + 10 \times 11 = 210 + 110 = 320 \).

   If you had chosen 'O-R-D', your payoff would have been \( 400 - 320 = 80 \).

3. **Current Strategy Consideration:**
   - Players on 'O-L-D' benefited last round as their payoff (120) was higher than what it would have been on 'O-R-D' (80).
   - Players might adjust based on perceived benefits, potentially shifting more players to 'O-L-D' to try and get a similar payoff in the new round.

4. **Anticipated Player Adjustment:**
   - Knowing that 'O-L-D' was slightly less crowded, more players could switch to 'O-L-D' this round.
   - Conversely, since 'O-R-D' had a higher cost, drivers may opt to switch routes to balance the costs.

5. **Strategic Choice:**
   - Evaluate the potential reduction of cost if more drivers switch to 'O-R-D'.
   - By considering shifting dynamics, choosing 'O-R-D' may now provide a lower cost if several drivers move to 'O-L-D' perceiving it as the better route.

Based on the analysis and anticipated player adjustments, I choose:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 13, 'O-R-D': 5}
Your payoff was 140

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's use the results from the most recent round to make a decision for this round.

1. **Last Round Outcome:**
   - Route 'O-L-D': 13 players
   - Route 'O-R-D': 5 players
   - Your payoff: 140
   
   This means that last round, the cost for 'O-R-D' was \( 210 + 10 \times 5 = 210 + 50 = 260 \), resulting in a payoff of \( 400 - 260 = 140 \).

   Hence, you chose 'O-R-D' last round.

2. **Cost Calculation for 'O-L-D' Last Round:**
   - The cost for players on the 'O-L-D' route would have been \( 10 \times 13 + 210 = 130 + 210 = 340 \).

   If you had chosen 'O-L-D', your payoff would have been \( 400 - 340 = 60 \).

3. **Current Strategy Consideration:**
   - Clearly, 'O-R-D' was the more advantageous route last round, providing a higher payoff.
   - Since significantly more players chose 'O-L-D' than 'O-R-D', it's reasonable to expect some players from 'O-L-D' to switch to 'O-R-D' in the current round aiming for a better payoff.

4. **Anticipated Player Adjustment:**
   - Players on 'O-L-D' who received a lower payoff may be inclined to switch to 'O-R-D', potentially increasing the number of drivers on 'O-R-D'.
   - If you choose 'O-L-D' now, and if fewer players are on it due to the previous outcome, the cost might decrease.

5. **Strategic Choice:**
   - To optimize payoff given last round's dynamics, choosing 'O-L-D' might be beneficial if enough switches back to 'O-R-D'.

Based on the analysis and potential shifts in player behavior, I choose:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 160

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's evaluate the situation based on the most recent results to make an informed decision for this round.

1. **Last Round Outcome:**
   - Route 'O-L-D': 3 players
   - Route 'O-R-D': 15 players
   - Your payoff: 160

   This means that during the last round, the cost for 'O-L-D' was \( 10 \times 3 + 210 = 30 + 210 = 240 \), resulting in a payoff of \( 400 - 240 = 160 \).

   Therefore, you chose 'O-L-D' last round.

2. **Cost Calculation for 'O-R-D' Last Round:**
   - The cost for players on the 'O-R-D' route was \( 210 + 10 \times 15 = 210 + 150 = 360 \).

   If you had chosen 'O-R-D', your payoff would have been \( 400 - 360 = 40 \).

3. **Current Strategy Consideration:**
   - 'O-L-D' was significantly less crowded and resulted in a higher payoff relative to 'O-R-D' last round.
   - Given the high number of players on 'O-R-D', it's predictable that many may switch to 'O-L-D', seeking a better payoff.

4. **Anticipated Player Adjustment:**
   - With a significant discrepancy in payoffs, many players on 'O-R-D' might switch to 'O-L-D'.
   - It's important to anticipate crowding on 'O-L-D', as players tend to swap to the route that provided better outcomes in the previous round.

5. **Strategic Choice:**
   - Considering likely player shifts, sticking with 'O-L-D' might become crowded, thus it may be beneficial to choose 'O-R-D' if the anticipated switch is significant.

Based on the likelihood of player movements and payoff optimization, for this round, I choose:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 13, 'O-R-D': 5}
Your payoff was 140

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given this new information, let's analyze it step-by-step to decide on the best strategy for the next round.

1. **Last Round Outcome:**
   - Route 'O-L-D': 13 players
   - Route 'O-R-D': 5 players
   - Your payoff: 140
   
   This means that last round, the cost for 'O-R-D' was \( 210 + 10 \times 5 = 210 + 50 = 260 \), resulting in a payoff of \( 400 - 260 = 140 \).

   Hence, you chose 'O-R-D' last round.

2. **Cost Calculation for 'O-L-D' Last Round:**
   - The cost for players on the 'O-L-D' route would have been \( 10 \times 13 + 210 = 130 + 210 = 340 \).

   If you had chosen 'O-L-D', your payoff would have been \( 400 - 340 = 60 \).

3. **Current Strategy Consideration:**
   - 'O-R-D' was the more advantageous route last round, with a higher payoff compared to 'O-L-D'.
   - With a large number on 'O-L-D', it's reasonable to expect that some players might now switch to 'O-R-D', hoping to receive a better payoff.

4. **Anticipated Player Adjustment:**
   - Players on 'O-L-D' who experienced a lower payoff might consider moving to 'O-R-D'.
   - This could balance or even overcrowd 'O-R-D' if many decide to switch.

5. **Strategic Choice:**
   - Choose based on risk assessment: sticking with 'O-R-D' might remain beneficial but could become less so if many 'O-L-D' players switch.

Based on the patterns and strategic considerations, I would choose to stay with:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 1, 'O-R-D': 17}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the results from the last round to make an informed decision for the upcoming round.

1. **Last Round Outcome:**
   - Route 'O-L-D': 1 player
   - Route 'O-R-D': 17 players
   - Your payoff: 20
   
   This payoff indicates that you were on 'O-R-D' because the calculated cost for 'O-R-D' was \( 210 + 10 \times 17 = 210 + 170 = 380 \), resulting in a payoff of \( 400 - 380 = 20 \).

2. **Cost Calculation for 'O-L-D' Last Round:**
   - For 'O-L-D', the cost for the single player would have been \( 10 \times 1 + 210 = 10 + 210 = 220 \).
   - The payoff for 'O-L-D' would have been \( 400 - 220 = 180 \).

3. **Current Strategy Consideration:**
   - During the last round, 'O-L-D' was significantly less crowded, leading to a much higher payoff.
   - It's reasonable to anticipate that many players from 'O-R-D' will switch to 'O-L-D' in the current round, seeking a better payoff.

4. **Anticipated Player Adjustment:**
   - Given the huge discrepancy in payoff, players from 'O-R-D' are likely to move towards 'O-L-D'.
   - This potential movement could overcrowd 'O-L-D'.

5. **Strategic Choice:**
   - To maximize payoff while anticipating crowding on 'O-L-D', consider that not everyone will switch instantly.
   - Choose 'O-L-D' when fewer players might still remain on 'O-R-D', yet be open to correcting this in subsequent rounds based on observed shifts.

Given these considerations, for this round, I choose:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Given the results from the most recent round, let's analyze them to make a strategic decision for the upcoming round.

1. **Last Round Outcome:**
   - Route 'O-L-D': 16 players
   - Route 'O-R-D': 2 players
   - Your payoff: 30
   
   Since your payoff was 30, this means that you were on 'O-L-D'. Let's compute the costs to verify:
   - Cost for 'O-L-D' was \( 10 \times 16 + 210 = 160 + 210 = 370 \).
   - Your payoff was \( 400 - 370 = 30 \).

2. **Cost Calculation for 'O-R-D' Last Round:**
   - The cost for 'O-R-D' was \( 210 + 10 \times 2 = 210 + 20 = 230 \).
   - If you had chosen 'O-R-D', your payoff would have been \( 400 - 230 = 170 \).

3. **Current Strategy Consideration:**
   - 'O-R-D' was significantly less crowded, resulting in a much higher theoretical payoff.
   - It is now predictable that many players on 'O-L-D' will switch to 'O-R-D' seeking a better payoff.

4. **Anticipated Player Adjustment:**
   - Large discrepancy in payoffs suggests many players will move from 'O-L-D' to 'O-R-D'.
   - This movement could cause a crowding effect on 'O-R-D'.

5. **Strategic Choice:**
   - Choose based on anticipated crowding: given that many players might switch to 'O-R-D', staying on 'O-L-D' could see a reduced number of players this round.

Given the likely player movements, for this round, I choose:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 160

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's consider the result from the last round and make a strategic decision for the next round.

1. **Last Round Outcome:**
   - Route 'O-L-D': 3 players
   - Route 'O-R-D': 15 players
   - Your payoff: 160
   
   Since your payoff was 160, this indicates you were on route 'O-L-D'. Let's verify the calculation:
   - Cost for 'O-L-D' was \( 10 \times 3 + 210 = 30 + 210 = 240 \).
   - Your payoff was \( 400 - 240 = 160 \).

2. **Cost Calculation for 'O-R-D' Last Round:**
   - The cost for 'O-R-D' was \( 210 + 10 \times 15 = 210 + 150 = 360 \).
   - If you had chosen 'O-R-D', your payoff would have been \( 400 - 360 = 40 \).

3. **Current Strategy Consideration:**
   - 'O-L-D' was significantly less crowded, resulting in a much better payoff compared to 'O-R-D'.
   - Players on 'O-R-D' who received a lower payoff are likely to move to 'O-L-D' based on previous outcomes.

4. **Anticipated Player Adjustment:**
   - Expect many players from 'O-R-D' to switch to 'O-L-D' in search of better payoffs, potentially making 'O-L-D' more crowded this round.
   - It's critical to anticipate movements to choose the less crowded route.

5. **Strategic Choice:**
   - To optimize your outcome knowing likely player behavior, choosing 'O-R-D' might be beneficial if an ample number of players switch back to 'O-L-D'.

Based on this analysis and considering potential shifts in player behavior, for the upcoming round, I choose:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 13, 'O-R-D': 5}
Your payoff was 140

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's revisit the situation based on last round's outcome to make an informed decision for the next round.

1. **Last Round Outcome:**
   - Route 'O-L-D': 13 players
   - Route 'O-R-D': 5 players
   - Your payoff: 140

   This indicates that you chose 'O-R-D'. Let's verify the calculation:
   - Cost for 'O-R-D' was \( 210 + 10 \times 5 = 210 + 50 = 260 \).
   - Your payoff was \( 400 - 260 = 140 \).

2. **Cost Calculation for 'O-L-D' Last Round:**
   - The cost for 'O-L-D' was \( 10 \times 13 + 210 = 130 + 210 = 340 \).
   - The payoff for choosing 'O-L-D' would have been \( 400 - 340 = 60 \).

3. **Current Strategy Consideration:**
   - 'O-R-D' granted a higher payoff last round, making it the better choice.
   - Many players who chose 'O-L-D' likely ended with a lower payoff and might switch to 'O-R-D' seeking a better payoff.

4. **Anticipated Player Adjustment:**
   - Players on 'O-L-D' may shift to 'O-R-D', expecting the trend of higher payoffs.
   - It's crucial to anticipate where crowding might occur this round and respond accordingly.

5. **Strategic Choice:**
   - Given the likely influx to 'O-R-D', there's a strategic advantage in choosing 'O-L-D' if you anticipate that others will be deterred by last round’s result.

Considering these dynamics, and in anticipation of player movements, I choose:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 4, 'O-R-D': 14}
Your payoff was 150

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Based on the information from the last round, let's analyze the outcomes to make a decision for the next round.

1. **Last Round Outcome:**
   - Route 'O-L-D': 4 players
   - Route 'O-R-D': 14 players
   - Your payoff: 150
   
   This indicates that you chose 'O-L-D'. Let's verify the calculations:
   - Cost for 'O-L-D' was \( 10 \times 4 + 210 = 40 + 210 = 250 \).
   - Your payoff was \( 400 - 250 = 150 \).

2. **Cost Calculation for 'O-R-D' Last Round:**
   - The cost for 'O-R-D' was \( 210 + 10 \times 14 = 210 + 140 = 350 \).
   - If you had chosen 'O-R-D', your payoff would have been \( 400 - 350 = 50 \).

3. **Current Strategy Consideration:**
   - 'O-L-D' was the better choice last round, offering a higher payoff.
   - Given that 'O-R-D' was crowded, players who were on 'O-R-D' might now switch to 'O-L-D' to try and get a better payoff.

4. **Anticipated Player Adjustment:**
   - It's likely that more players will shift to 'O-L-D', increasing its crowding this round.
   - You must decide whether to stay on 'O-L-D' or switch to 'O-R-D', anticipating others' movements.

5. **Strategic Choice:**
   - Considering the dynamics, if many are expected to move to 'O-L-D', it might be beneficial to switch to 'O-R-D'.

Based on this analysis and potential player adjustments, I would choose:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```
