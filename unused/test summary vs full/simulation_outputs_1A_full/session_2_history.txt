System: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 10 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 10 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make an informed decision, let's analyze the potential costs and strategically choose a route that minimizes travel expenses.

1. **Understanding the Routes and Costs:**
   - Route 'O-L-D': Travel cost is made up of a variable segment cost (10 times the number of drivers choosing this route) plus a fixed cost of 210.
   - Route 'O-R-D': Travel cost is a fixed segment cost of 210 plus a variable segment cost (10 times the number of drivers choosing the subsequent segment R-D).

2. **Objective:**
   - Our objective is to minimize travel costs to maximize the leftover from the endowment of 400 points.

3. **Initial Considerations:**
   - If more drivers choose a particular route, the cost on that path will increase due to the variable component.
   - We need to predict or estimate the likely choices of other drivers to avoid the higher traffic route.

4. **Strategic Decision:**
   - Without specific information on other drivers' behavior and assuming a balanced interest in both routes, selecting a less obvious route might be strategic to avoid congestion.
   - Given two equilibria scenarios: 
     - All drivers evenly distribute, i.e., 9 on each route.
     - Most drivers favor a fixed-cost route 'O-R-D' due to its straightforward cost without initial player interaction (guess).

5. **Based on the Experiment Premise:**
   - Drivers may naturally over time tend towards the route 'O-R-D' due to its simplicity unless influenced by initial encouragements to test other waters (like through feedback mechanisms).
   - Supposing we wish to test less traveled options and potentially benefit from less traffic, we might initially opt for 'O-L-D'.

By analyzing possible distributions and considering default player behaviors (possibly favoring fixed routes without initial commitment), I'll choose:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 7, 'O-R-D': 11}
Your payoff was 120

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make the decision for this round, let's examine the information provided and the situation from the last round.

1. **Cost Analysis from Last Round:**
   - Last round, 7 drivers chose 'O-L-D', and 11 drivers chose 'O-R-D'.
   - Your route choice led to a payoff of 120, meaning your total travel cost was 280 (400 starting points - 120 payoff).
   - To verify: if you were on 'O-R-D', the cost would have been 210 (fixed) + 10 * 11 (drivers on R-D) = 320, which matches total cost reported inaccurately. This suggests you were likely on 'O-R-D', incurring higher costs.

2. **Strategic Overview:**
   - Players on 'O-L-D' had a cost of 10 * 7 + 210 = 280. Your payoff suggests you were not here either, but rather caught in a misreport (uninterpolated).
   - Predicting players may now notice the congestion cost and shift, expect shifts towards 'O-L-D'.

3. **Adaptive Thinking and Decision:**
   - If more participants recognize the high cost incurred on 'O-R-D' last round due to crowding, they may now shift to 'O-L-D'.
   - A strategic choice would anticipate others switching to 'O-L-D', potentially equalizing or congesting it.
   - Assuming rational adjustments, moderate numbers potentially equalize on each, making unsolvables anew.

4. **Prediction and Choice:**
   - Given last round's outcome where most piled onto 'O-R-D', players may shift strategies to explore 'O-L-D'.
   - Recurrence effects: Suppose about 9 participants navigate this, you select to stabilize ('O-L-D' adapts waver-level).

Therefore, strategically choosing routes for balance shift and cost issues, I'll opt for:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 13, 'O-R-D': 5}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the current situation and determine the best route choice for this round.

1. **Last Round Analysis:**
   - Last round, 13 drivers chose 'O-L-D' and 5 drivers chose 'O-R-D'.
   - Your payoff was 60, meaning your total travel cost was 340 (400 starting points - 60 payoff).
   - If you chose 'O-L-D' last round, the cost would be 10 * 13 + 210 = 340, which matches your calculated cost. Therefore, you were on 'O-L-D'.

2. **Understanding Traffic Dynamics:**
   - 'O-L-D' was heavily congested with 13 participants leading to high costs.
   - 'O-R-D' had only 5 participants last round leading to a cost of 210 + 10 * 5 = 260, which would have resulted in a higher payoff of 140 for those players.

3. **Forecasting Behavior:**
   - Given the high number of drivers on 'O-L-D' and the poor payoff, it is likely that some players will switch to 'O-R-D' this round to minimize their costs.
   - It is reasonable to expect a redistribution where more players consider 'O-R-D'.

4. **Decision Strategy:**
   - To capitalize on this, and considering the previous congestion on 'O-L-D', it would be strategic to choose 'O-R-D' to potentially lower travel costs.
   - Players who see the cost data might realize the switch benefits, so moving to less crowded expected 'O-R-D'.

5. **Choice Conclusion:**
   - Anticipating that several players will move away from the heavily crowded 'O-L-D', thereby balancing the distribution, making a less obvious choice at this point involves moving.
   
Based on the above considerations, the strategic decision this round would be:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the situation based on the previous round's outcome and determine the optimal route choice for this round.

1. **Last Round Analysis:**
   - 3 drivers chose 'O-L-D', and 15 drivers chose 'O-R-D'.
   - Your payoff was 40, indicating a travel cost of 360 (400 starting points - 40 payoff).
   - If you were on 'O-R-D', the last round cost would have been 210 (fixed) + 10 * 15 = 360, matching your cost. Therefore, you were on 'O-R-D'.

2. **Player Dynamics and Predictions:**
   - 'O-R-D' was heavily congested, resulting in high costs for the individuals who took this route.
   - 'O-L-D' had only 3 participants, leading to a much lower cost of 10 * 3 + 210 = 240, which would have resulted in a payoff of 160 for those players.

3. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - Given the last round's outcome, it's highly likely that many players will switch from 'O-R-D' to 'O-L-D' since the previous costs were significantly lower on 'O-L-D'.
   - This shift could lead to increased congestion on 'O-L-D' in the current round.

4. **Considerations for This Round:**
   - It's important to anticipate where other participants might move based on cost effectiveness. Players on 'O-R-D' last round may be inclined to switch to 'O-L-D'.
   - Avoiding overcrowding is crucial to minimize costs, so choosing the likely less traveled route becomes strategic.

5. **Optimal Choice:**
   - To potentially avoid congestion based on player adjustments, the best choice would be to switch to 'O-L-D', since it was underutilized last round.

Given these observations, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 13, 'O-R-D': 5}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's consider the data from the last round and analyze how to make a strategic route choice for this round.

1. **Last Round Analysis:**
   - 13 drivers chose 'O-L-D', while 5 drivers chose 'O-R-D'.
   - Your payoff was 60, indicating a travel cost of 340 (400 starting points - 60 payoff).
   - If you chose 'O-L-D', the cost was 10 * 13 + 210 = 340, matching your cost, so you were on 'O-L-D'.

2. **Evaluating Route Costs:**
   - 'O-L-D' became heavily congested last round, resulting in higher costs for those who chose it.
   - 'O-R-D' had fewer participants, resulting in a cost of 210 + 10 * 5 = 260, with a payoff of 140 for drivers who chose this route.

3. **Forecasting Driver Behavior:**
   - Given the high cost of 'O-L-D' last round, participants are likely to reassess their route choice and may switch toward 'O-R-D' to avoid high costs.
   - The payoff for 'O-R-D' was significantly higher last round, which might attract more drivers this time, potentially increasing its congestion.

4. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - Given the trends and tendencies, anticipate that more drivers are likely to switch away from 'O-L-D' and possibly crowd 'O-R-D'.
   - Choosing a route involves predicting the shift to balance choices effectively.

5. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Considering players will likely adjust based on the previous costly experience on 'O-L-D', moving to 'O-R-D', for them to avoid repetition, might get over localised as contrarily viable.
   - Choosing fewer populated 'O-L-D' can, therefore, potentially minimize your costs this round if the predictive shift swings opposite.

Based on this analysis, the strategic decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 1, 'O-R-D': 17}
Your payoff was 20

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the outcome from the last round and determine the best route choice for this round.

1. **Last Round Analysis:**
   - 1 driver chose 'O-L-D', and 17 drivers chose 'O-R-D'.
   - Your payoff was 20, indicating a travel cost of 380 (400 starting points - 20 payoff).
   - If you were on 'O-R-D', your cost would have been 210 (fixed) + 10 * 17 = 380, which aligns with your payoff.

2. **Driver Behavior and Cost Dynamics:**
   - 'O-R-D' was heavily congested last round, resulting in very high costs.
   - The lone driver on 'O-L-D' incurred a cost of 10 * 1 + 210 = 220, enjoying a payoff of 180, which is significantly better.

3. **Strategic Anticipation:**
   - It is likely that many participants who experienced the high costs on 'O-R-D' last round will now consider switching to 'O-L-D' due to the more favorable payoff observed.

4. **Decision Strategy:**
   - Given the observed trend and the responses of participants to cost efficiency, a switch of significant participants to 'O-L-D' can be expected.
   - Choosing a route strategically involves anticipating such behavioral adjustments to select less congested alternatives.

5. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Since 'O-L-D' was underutilized last round and provided better payouts, more participants may switch there.
   - Predicting this shift, and avoiding crowding, selecting the least contenders recognizes an opportunity on 'O-R-D'.

For this round, taking into account the expected behavioral adjustments and aiming to benefit from reduced player crowding, the strategic choice is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
Your payoff was 30

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a well-informed decision for this round, let's break down what happened last round and predict the next best move.

1. **Last Round Analysis:**
   - 16 drivers chose 'O-L-D', while only 2 drivers chose 'O-R-D'.
   - You received a payoff of 30, indicating your travel cost was 370 (400 starting points - 30 payoff).
   - If you chose 'O-L-D', the travel cost would have been 10 * 16 + 210 = 370, aligning with your cost. Therefore, you were on 'O-L-D'.

2. **Route Cost Evaluation:**
   - 'O-L-D' was vastly overcrowded with 16 participants, leading to very high costs.
   - 'O-R-D', with only 2 participants, would have incurred a cost of 210 + 10 * 2 = 230, resulting in a payoff of 170, which is significantly better.

3. **Forecasting Behavior:**
   - Many players who faced the high costs on 'O-L-D' are likely to switch to 'O-R-D' for a chance at lower costs.
   - Participants observing the payoff results will notice the significant advantage of 'O-R-D' when less crowded.

4. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - Given the trend, expect a redistribution where participants may flock to the more lucrative option based on past round performance.
   - To minimize costs, identifying where the least switch congestion might occur is key.

5. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Since 'O-R-D' was underutilized, it should attract more participants. However, forecasting that not everyone may switch can balance 'O-L-D', based purely on alternating expectations.

In conclusion, predicting strategic shifts and selecting a less anticipated crowded route for cost-benefit balance, the decision is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 3, 'O-R-D': 15}
Your payoff was 40

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To determine the optimal route choice for this round, let's analyze the previous round's results and predict player behavior:

1. **Last Round Analysis:**
   - 3 drivers chose 'O-L-D', and 15 drivers chose 'O-R-D'.
   - Your payoff was 40, indicating a travel cost of 360 (400 starting points - 40 payoff).
   - If you chose 'O-R-D', the travel cost would have been 210 (fixed) + 10 * 15 (drivers on R-D) = 360, which aligns with your cost. Therefore, you were on 'O-R-D'.

2. **Route Cost Evaluation:**
   - 'O-R-D' was heavily congested, resulting in very high travel costs.
   - 'O-L-D', with only 3 participants, incurred a lower cost of 10 * 3 + 210 = 240, which means those participants enjoyed a payoff of 160.

3. **Predicting Driver Behavior:**
   - Many participants who experienced high costs on 'O-R-D' are likely to consider switching to 'O-L-D' for lower costs.
   - Observing the previous payoff advantages of 'O-L-D', more players may be tempted to switch.

4. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - Given recent trends and the tendency of drivers to choose routes offering better payoffs, expect a possible shift toward 'O-L-D'.
   - Choosing a route requires anticipating player movements to avoid over-crowding and high costs.

5. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Since more players might shift to 'O-L-D', expect possible congestion. Conversely, the fewer high-costs history on 'O-R-D' cannot be overlooked, given player rotational play changes.

To exploit the anticipated behaviors and manage potential congestion efficiently, the decision for this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 13, 'O-R-D': 5}
Your payoff was 60

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: To make a strategic decision for this round, let's analyze the results from the last round and predict how participants will respond:

1. **Last Round Analysis:**
   - 13 drivers chose 'O-L-D', while 5 drivers chose 'O-R-D'.
   - Your payoff was 60, indicating a travel cost of 340 (400 starting points - 60 payoff).
   - If you were on 'O-L-D', the travel cost would have been 10 * 13 + 210 = 340, which matches your cost. Therefore, you were on 'O-L-D'.

2. **Route Cost Evaluation:**
   - 'O-L-D' was crowded with 13 participants, leading to higher travel costs.
   - 'O-R-D', having only 5 participants, incurred a cost of 210 + 10 * 5 = 260, yielding a payoff of 140, which was much better.

3. **Predicting Driver Behavior:**
   - After experiencing high costs on 'O-L-D', many drivers might look to switch to 'O-R-D', where the payoff was higher.
   - Players observing these trends might choose 'O-R-D' for its lower current cost.

4. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - Given the tendency for players to migrate towards routes with historically lower costs, anticipate that 'O-R-D' may attract more drivers this round.
   - The strategy should push towards selecting a route that appears likely to be less congested this round.

5. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - Knowing probable movements reflecting towards improved outcomes before the congestion curve forms on 'O-R-D', the optimal decision for you hinges on predicting realistic shifts.

Given the analysis and expected behavior change, the decision is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-L-D': 4, 'O-R-D': 14}
Your payoff was 50

Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

AI: Let's analyze the outcomes from the last round and strategize for the current round:

1. **Last Round Analysis:**
   - 4 drivers chose 'O-L-D', and 14 drivers chose 'O-R-D'.
   - Your payoff was 50, implying your travel cost was 350 (400 starting points - 50 payoff).
   - If you were on 'O-R-D', the travel cost would have been 210 (fixed) + 10 * 14 = 350, which aligns with your cost. Therefore, you were on 'O-R-D'.

2. **Route Cost Evaluation:**
   - 'O-R-D' experienced significant congestion, leading to high travel costs.
   - Meanwhile, 'O-L-D' had only 4 participants, with a cost of 10 * 4 + 210 = 250, leading to a substantially better payoff of 150.

3. **Predicting Driver Behavior:**
   - Many drivers who experienced high costs on 'O-R-D' are likely considering a switch to 'O-L-D' after seeing the lower cost and better payoff.
   - This likely shift will impact the traffic distribution, possibly making 'O-L-D' more crowded this round.

4. **Strategic Decision Making:**
   - Given these dynamics, it's expected that some redistribution of drivers will occur, with several switching to 'O-L-D'.
   - Choosing a route involves predicting this behavior effectively.

5. **Optimal Route Choice:**
   - With many drivers potentially moving towards 'O-L-D', the congestion might increase there.
   - Strategically exploiting expected behavior, selecting 'O-R-D' could present less congestion if participants recognize trends.

Considering the analysis and anticipating the possible switch in driver distribution, the choice this round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```
