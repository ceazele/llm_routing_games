System Message:

You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 10 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 10 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Round 1:
Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
Let's walk through the decision-making process step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Cost Structure:**
   - Route 'O-L-D': Cost = \(10X + 210\)
   - Route 'O-R-D': Cost = \(210 + 10Y\)
   - Here, \(X\) is the number of drivers choosing 'O-L-D' and \(Y\) is the number of drivers choosing 'O-R-D'.

2. **Objective:**
   - The objective is to minimize travel costs, which maximizes the payoff. Given an endowment of 400 points, the payoff is calculated as \( \text{Payoff} = 400 - \text{Travel Cost} \).

3. **Analyzing Driver Choices:**
   - If a large number of drivers choose 'O-L-D', the cost on this route increases for each of them, and vice versa for 'O-R-D'.
   - Ideally, the distribution of drivers will balance out or one route will tend to be overcrowded over multiple rounds.

4. **Strategy:**
   - Consider recent rounds and adjust based on whether drivers are crowding one particular route.
   - If you anticipate more drivers are likely to avoid congestion on 'O-L-D', fewer drivers may use 'O-R-D', making 'O-R-D' potentially less costly.

5. **Initial Guess:**
   - As no previous round data or behavior pattern is provided, an initial random choice can be made, or start with one route to observe outcomes:
   - An even split is the theoretical optimal where:
     - \(X = 9\) for 'O-L-D' and \(Y = 9\) for 'O-R-D', both leading to equal costs.
   - However, without knowing the distribution, a safer approach is typically to select 'O-R-D' initially to avoid potential initial overcrowding on 'O-L-D'.

Let's choose 'O-R-D' for this round.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 2:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 70.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 6 agents
        O-R-D: 12 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision about which route to take, let's analyze the information from the previous round and the current options:

### Available Routes:
1. **O-L-D**
   - Cost Function: \(10X + 210\)
   - X = Number of participants choosing O-L-D

2. **O-R-D**
   - Cost Function: \(210 + 10Y\)
   - Y = Number of participants choosing O-R-D

### Summary of Round 1:

- **Your Choice**: O-R-D
- **Payoff**: 70
- **Number of Agents**:
  - O-L-D: 6 agents
  - O-R-D: 12 agents

#### Travel Cost Calculation for Round 1:

1. **Route O-R-D (Your Choice):**
   - Travel Cost: \(210 + 10 \times 12 = 210 + 120 = 330\)
   - Payoff Calculation: \(400 - 330 = 70\)

2. **Route O-L-D (Other Route):**
   - Travel Cost: \(10 \times 6 + 210 = 60 + 210 = 270\)

### Analysis:

- In Round 1, the travel cost for O-L-D was 270 and for O-R-D was 330.
- A higher number of drivers (12) chose O-R-D, increasing its cost significantly.
- Fewer drivers (6) chose O-L-D, maintaining a relatively lower cost.

### Strategic Considerations:

1. **Route O-L-D**:
   - Currently, a smaller group chooses this route.
   - Lower relative cost when fewer drivers choose it (as was the case in Round 1).

2. **Route O-R-D**:
   - If many drivers continue to choose this route, the cost will remain high.
   - Historically higher participation leading to higher costs.

### Decision:

Based on the analysis, Route O-L-D had a lower cost in Round 1. If a similar pattern follows, choosing O-L-D may yield a higher payoff. Thus, I will select Route O-L-D for the next round.

```json
{
  "route": "O-L-D"
}
```

Round 3:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 70.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 6 agents
        O-R-D: 12 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 18 agents
        O-R-D: 0 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision for the upcoming round, let's analyze the previous rounds to understand the situation better:

### Analysis of Previous Rounds

#### Round 1:
- **Choice**: O-R-D
- **Number of agents**: 
  - O-L-D: 6 agents
  - O-R-D: 12 agents
- **Travel Cost Calculation for O-R-D**:
  - Fixed cost for O-R: 210
  - Variable cost for R-D: \(10 \times 12 = 120\)
  - Total Travel Cost: \(210 + 120 = 330\)
- **Payoff Calculation**:
  - Endowment: 400
  - Travel Cost: 330
  - Payoff: \(400 - 330 = 70\)

#### Round 2:
- **Choice**: O-L-D
- **Number of agents**:
  - O-L-D: 18 agents
  - O-R-D: 0 agents
- **Travel Cost Calculation for O-L-D**:
  - Variable cost for O-L: \(10 \times 18 = 180\)
  - Fixed cost for L-D: 210
  - Total Travel Cost: \(180 + 210 = 390\)
- **Payoff Calculation**:
  - Endowment: 400
  - Travel Cost: 390
  - Payoff: \(400 - 390 = 10\)

### Strategy for Next Round

Given the results from the previous rounds:
1. In Round 1, choosing O-R-D resulted in a better payoff than choosing O-L-D in Round 2.
2. The cost-effectiveness of a route depends heavily on the number of agents selecting that route.

### Decision for the Next Round

To maximize the payoff, the goal is to select the route with the least expected number of agents, thereby minimizing the dependence on variable costs. Since in Round 2, everyone switched to O-L-D, it might influence some drivers to switch back to O-R-D due to the high cost experienced. 

Since there's zero existing data indicating other participants' strategies, making a probabilistic alignment with Round 1 could be more rewarding. Therefore, selecting O-R-D appears to be a better strategic choice, as the probability of fewer agents might increase based on Round 2’s result.

### Conclusion

Select the route O-R-D for the next round.

```json
{
  "route": "O-R-D"
}
```

Round 4:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 70.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 6 agents
        O-R-D: 12 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 18 agents
        O-R-D: 0 agents

Round 3:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 0 agents
        O-R-D: 18 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
In this decision-making problem, our primary goal is to maximize our payoff by minimizing the travel costs, which are influenced by the number of drivers on each route. Let's analyze the given data from previous rounds before making a decision for the next one.

### Analysis of Previous Rounds:

1. **Round 1:**
   - **Route Chosen:** O-R-D
   - **Payoff Received:** 70
   - **Distribution of Agents:** O-L-D: 6, O-R-D: 12
   - **Cost Calculation:**
     - \[ \text{Cost for O-R-D} = 210 + 10 \times 12 = 330 \]
     - \[ \text{Payoff} = 400 - 330 = 70 \]
   - Observation: The high number of agents (12) on route O-R-D increased the cost significantly.

2. **Round 2:**
   - **Route Chosen:** O-L-D
   - **Payoff Received:** 10
   - **Distribution of Agents:** O-L-D: 18, O-R-D: 0
   - **Cost Calculation:**
     - \[ \text{Cost for O-L-D} = 10 \times 18 + 210 = 390 \]
     - \[ \text{Payoff} = 400 - 390 = 10 \]
   - Observation: All agents crowded into the same route, resulting in a very high cost.

3. **Round 3:**
   - **Route Chosen:** O-R-D
   - **Payoff Received:** 10
   - **Distribution of Agents:** O-L-D: 0, O-R-D: 18
   - **Cost Calculation:**
     - \[ \text{Cost for O-R-D} = 210 + 10 \times 18 = 390 \]
     - \[ \text{Payoff} = 400 - 390 = 10 \]
   - Observation: Again, all agents crowded one route, resulting in high costs.

### Strategy for Next Round:

From the analysis, it's clear that avoiding routes with a high number of agents is crucial. The challenge is predicting the distribution of agents on each route, given no agents will purposely choose a crowded route if they can help it.

- **Expected driver behavior:** Drivers might want to switch routes to avoid congestion, or they might try to predict where others will switch. After two rounds of heavy congestion, drivers might start dispersing again to optimize their individual payoffs.

- **Optimal Decision:** Attempting to choose the route with lower expected traffic. Given the unpredictable nature of coordination among drivers, it could be beneficial to choose the route that wasn't crowded in the last round, hoping others switch. Since O-L-D was extremely crowded in Round 2, and no one chose it in Round 3, it's likely to be less crowded again in the upcoming round.

With that consideration, I will choose route **O-L-D** for the next round.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 5:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 70.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 6 agents
        O-R-D: 12 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 18 agents
        O-R-D: 0 agents

Round 3:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 0 agents
        O-R-D: 18 agents

Round 4:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 60.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 13 agents
        O-R-D: 5 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision about the next route selection, let's analyze the data from the previous rounds:

1. **Round 1:**
   - **Route Chosen:** O-R-D
   - **Payoff:** 70
   - **Agent Distribution:** O-L-D: 6 agents, O-R-D: 12 agents
   - **Travel Cost for O-R-D:** 400 (endowment) - 70 (payoff) = 330
   - **Inference:** More agents on O-R-D led to higher individual costs but a still decent payoff. However, it suggests congestion on O-R-D.

2. **Round 2:**
   - **Route Chosen:** O-L-D
   - **Payoff:** 10
   - **Agent Distribution:** O-L-D: 18 agents, O-R-D: 0 agents
   - **Travel Cost for O-L-D:** 400 - 10 = 390
   - **Inference:** Everyone shifted to O-L-D, likely due to Round 1 payoffs, making it very congested and costly.

3. **Round 3:**
   - **Route Chosen:** O-R-D
   - **Payoff:** 10
   - **Agent Distribution:** O-L-D: 0 agents, O-R-D: 18 agents
   - **Travel Cost for O-R-D:** 400 - 10 = 390
   - **Inference:** Complete shift to O-R-D, resulting in congestion similar to Round 2's situation on O-L-D.

4. **Round 4:**
   - **Route Chosen:** O-L-D
   - **Payoff:** 60
   - **Agent Distribution:** O-L-D: 13 agents, O-R-D: 5 agents
   - **Travel Cost for O-L-D:** 400 - 60 = 340
   - **Inference:** This round shows less congestion on O-L-D, yielding a better payoff and suggesting a balance between routes.

**Decision Strategy:**
Given the historical pattern where participants alternate moving en masse between routes based on previous round costs and payoffs, we must aim for balance or predict shifts:

- Rounds 2 and 3 were heavily biased towards a route based on previous poor payoffs on the other route. Such drastic movements significantly increased costs due to congestion.
- Round 4 showed that when the agents were more evenly split, specifically with less on O-R-D, payoffs became better.

**Prediction for Next Round:**
Participants have recognized the pattern of alternating heavily between the routes. Therefore, there might be a tendency for them to continue on O-L-D or slightly shift toward O-R-D but not overwhelmingly as seen before.

- Choosing O-R-D might be advantageous if enough participants remain on O-L-D while trying to balance out the costs, as seen in Round 4.

Thus, the decision would be to choose route **O-R-D** anticipating a more balanced distribution of participants and better payoffs from reduced congestion.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 6:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 70.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 6 agents
        O-R-D: 12 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 18 agents
        O-R-D: 0 agents

Round 3:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 0 agents
        O-R-D: 18 agents

Round 4:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 60.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 13 agents
        O-R-D: 5 agents

Round 5:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 60.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 5 agents
        O-R-D: 13 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To determine the optimal route for the next round, let's analyze the data from the previous rounds and the associated payoffs:

1. **Round Summary:**

   - **Round 1:** O-R-D yielded a payoff of 70 with 12 agents.  
   - **Round 2:** O-L-D resulted in a payoff of 10 with 18 agents.  
   - **Round 3:** O-R-D also resulted in a payoff of 10 with 18 agents.  
   - **Round 4:** O-L-D gave a payoff of 60 with 13 agents.  
   - **Round 5:** O-R-D yielded a payoff of 60 with 13 agents.  

2. **Payoff Evaluation:**

   - High payoff of 70 (Round 1) for O-R-D when there were fewer agents (12 agents on O-R-D, 6 on O-L-D).
   - Both routes had low payoffs of 10 when all agents chose the same route entirely: 18 agents on one route (Round 2 for O-L-D and Round 3 for O-R-D).
   - Balanced splits between agents on routes tend to yield higher payoffs: 
     - 13 agents on O-L-D, 5 on O-R-D resulted in a payoff of 60 (Round 4).
     - 5 agents on O-L-D, 13 on O-R-D resulted in a payoff of 60 (Round 5).

3. **Strategy to Maximize Payoff:**

   - Higher payoffs were observed in situations when the agents were more evenly split over the two routes (not too few and not too many) leading to a cost around the middle range.
   - The goal should be to choose a route that maximizes my payoff by avoiding overcrowded routes.
   - Given there's no clear pattern regarding other agents' behaviors, it might be beneficial to alternate between routes based on previous over-crowding.

4. **Decision for Next Round:**

   - Since Round 5 had more agents on O-R-D, it could be advantageous to switch to O-L-D if we assume others might continue choosing O-R-D due to the previous favorable payoff when they chose O-R-D with 13 agents.
   - Avoiding an overcrowded route is key; predicting the path less taken based on alternating behavior could yield a better payoff.

Thus, based on the above analysis, it might be beneficial to choose the route that had fewer agents in the last round (O-L-D), assuming others will switch less. Therefore, the selected route is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 7:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 70.

- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 12 agents
        O-R-D: 6 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide on the route for the next round, I'll analyze the results from previous rounds to identify patterns and outcomes that can help predict the behavior of other agents.

1. **Observation from Rounds**:
   - **Round 1**: Route O-R-D had 12 agents, and I received 70 points.
   - **Round 2**: Route O-L-D had 18 agents, resulting in a minimum payoff of 10 points.
   - **Round 3**: Route O-R-D had 18 agents, also resulting in 10 points.
   - **Round 4**: Route O-L-D was chosen by 13 agents, resulting in 60 points.
   - **Round 5**: Route O-R-D was chosen by 13 agents, resulting in 60 points.
   - **Round 6**: Route O-L-D was chosen by 12 agents, yielding a higher payoff of 70 points.

2. **Pattern and Strategic Thinking**:
   - Large numbers on a route lead to very low payoffs (10 points) as seen in Rounds 2 and 3.
   - Payoffs are decent (60 to 70 points) when around 12 agents choose the route.
   - Alternating between routes or small shifts in agent distribution could lead to more favorable payoffs.
   - In recent rounds, fewer people on O-L-D could potentially provide a higher payoff.

3. **Prediction for Next Round**:
   - There is a possibility that fewer agents may choose O-L-D after it starts becoming crowded, leading to better payoff opportunities there.

4. **Decision**:
   - I will choose route **O-L-D**, hoping the number of agents using it will slightly decrease compared to previous rounds, allowing for a higher payoff.

Here is the JSON output corresponding to my decision:

```json
{
  "route": "O-L-D"
}
```

Round 8:

Round 6:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 70.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 12 agents

- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 6 agents
        O-R-D: 12 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide which route to choose, let's analyze the data from the previous rounds:

1. **Rounds 1 and 7**: When I chose route O-R-D, my payoff was 70, and when others chose it, they had a high number of agents (12 in round 1 and 12 in round 7 too). Route O-L-D had 6 agents, resulting in better payoffs when chosen (130 points in round 7 for me).

2. **Round 2**: All agents, including myself, chose route O-L-D, resulting in a low payoff (10 points). This demonstrates that if too many agents choose O-L-D, the cost drastically increases.

3. **Round 3**: Everyone chose route O-R-D, yielding another low payoff (10 points). This shows overcrowding on O-R-D resulted in excessive cost.

4. **Round 4**: I received a payoff of 60 by choosing O-L-D when 13 agents were on O-L-D and 5 on O-R-D. My observed pattern is that, as the number of agents is balanced or less on O-L-D, the payoff benefits.

5. **Round 5**: I received a payoff of 60 with the majority on O-R-D (13) and fewer on O-L-D (5). Again, less crowded routes gave better payoffs.

6. **Round 6**: I achieved a payoff of 70 on O-L-D with 12 agents on this route while 6 chose O-R-D. Lower occupancy on O-R-D seems optimal for cost balance.

7. **Round 7**: I achieved a high payoff of 130 for choosing O-L-D with 6 agents on it while 12 took O-R-D, indicating advantages when the other route is crowded.

**Analysis and Decision:**
Balancing occupancy between the routes tends to provide better payoffs. Historically, lower numbers on O-L-D either resulted in high payoffs or reasonable ones, whereas O-R-D fluctuated more drastically in results.

- **If prediction holds**—route O-L-D seems to offer a potential benefit based on the historical less overcrowding and payoffs in the last round.
- **Strategy**: Choose the route where fewer participants are likely to go, considering alternating patterns and recent biases.

Based on these observations, the best choice for the upcoming round is probably to maintain or return to the less currently popular choice, which might be route O-L-D if others revert back to O-R-D expecting balance but speculation in expected trends suggest higher O-R-D attraction. Therefore, choose route O-L-D.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an optimal decision, let's analyze the information from the previous rounds and calculate the potential outcomes:

1. **Review of Past Outcomes:**
   - When fewer people choose a route, the variable cost (dependent on the number of agents on variable segments) tends to be lower, leading to a higher payoff.
   - The goal is to choose the route with the fewest agents to minimize the variable segment costs.

2. **Past Decision Analysis:**
   - High payoff rounds (Round 1: 70, Round 6: 70, Round 7: 130) occurred with a more balanced or favorable distribution of agents.
   - Low payoff rounds (Round 2: 10, Round 3: 10) occurred when all agents crowded into the same route.
   - In Round 7, choosing O-L-D yielded a particularly high payoff because only 6 agents chose it, minimizing the cost of segment O-L, which is 10X (10*6 = 60).

3. **Pattern Observation:**
   - There is a repeated pattern of agents reacting to past decisions, leading to more agents switching in subsequent rounds to balance out the costs.

4. **Prediction for Next Round:**
   - Observing that in Round 8, 13 agents chose O-L-D, it might lead to a shift where more agents will choose O-R-D in the upcoming round.
   - However, there is an element of unpredictability depending on the strategy of other agents based on their recollection of previous rounds.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - Considering the trend and noting that sometimes routes equilibrate with 12:6 or 6:12 split, there is a possibility agents will again align similarly.
   - Choosing the route that might end up with fewer agents can be beneficial for a higher payoff.

Based on this analysis, I would choose route **O-L-D** for the next round, anticipating it may again become less crowded after they might crowd into O-R-D based on Round 8's outcome.

Therefore, my decision for the next round is:

{"route": "O-L-D"}

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To determine the optimal route for Round 10, let's analyze the outcomes and patterns from previous rounds:

1. **Past Outcomes**:
   - **Round 1**: Chose O-R-D, payoff was 70 (12 agents on O-R-D).
   - **Round 2**: Chose O-L-D, payoff was 10 (18 agents on O-L-D).
   - **Round 3**: Chose O-R-D, payoff was 10 (18 agents on O-R-D).
   - **Round 4**: Chose O-L-D, payoff was 60 (13 agents on O-L-D).
   - **Round 5**: Chose O-R-D, payoff was 60 (13 agents on O-R-D).
   - **Round 6**: Chose O-L-D, payoff was 70 (12 agents on O-L-D).
   - **Round 7**: Chose O-L-D, payoff was 130 (6 agents on O-L-D).
   - **Round 8**: Chose O-L-D, payoff was 60 (13 agents on O-L-D).
   - **Round 9**: Chose O-L-D, payoff was 150 (4 agents on O-L-D).

2. **Pattern Observations**:
   - Higher payoffs are achieved when fewer participants choose the same route.
   - The O-L-D route tends to provide better payoffs when fewer agents choose it, especially when the number drops below 7 or 6.
   - The O-R-D route had mixed results, but still provided a reasonable payoff when fewer agents (around 5 or 6) chose it.

3. **Recent Trends**:
   - In Rounds 7 and 9, choosing O-L-D resulted in high payoffs because the number of agents on that route was low.
   - In the previous round (Round 9), 14 agents chose O-R-D, which implies that many agents might have switched to O-R-D after seeing low numbers on O-L-D in Round 8.

4. **Strategic Decision**:
   - It's likely that agents might switch routes again based on previous outcomes, leading to a fluctuating pattern.
   - Since Round 9 had a lower number of agents on O-L-D and a high payoff, competitors might react by mostly going back to O-R-D.
   - To maximize payoff in Round 10, it may be advantageous to choose the less crowded current round based on prior low numbers, potentially continuing with the O-L-D route in anticipation of others switching back to O-R-D.

Based on this analysis, the optimal choice likely involves selecting the route that tends to have fewer drivers, which in this case is likely to be O-L-D, in hopes that after Round 9 others may have moved to O-R-D due to patterns in Rounds 8 and 9.
