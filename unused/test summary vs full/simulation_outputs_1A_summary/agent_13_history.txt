System Message:

You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 10 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 10 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Round 1:
Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision on which route to choose, let's carefully analyze the cost structure and implications of each route choice. Our objective is to minimize travel costs and maximize our payoff from the initial endowment of 400 points. Here’s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Understand the Cost Functions:**
   - Route O-L-D: The travel cost is 10X + 210, where X is the number of drivers choosing this route.
   - Route O-R-D: Here, the travel cost is 210 + 10Y, where Y is the number of drivers choosing this route.
   - For both routes, the total cost is influenced by the number of drivers, which increases the variable component of the cost.

2. **Initial Observations:**
   - Route O-L-D's cost is heavily dependent on X. If fewer drivers choose this route, the variable cost is low.
   - Similarly, Route O-R-D's cost is contingent on Y, and a lower Y results in a lower cost here as well.
   - If all drivers chose the same route, it would significantly increase the travel cost on that route due to the variable component becoming large.

3. **Strategy Considerations:**
   - A balanced distribution of drivers between both routes may ideally minimize costs for everyone.
   - If the majority choose one route, counterintuitively choosing the less popular route might yield a lower cost.
   - It’s critical to predict the others’ behaviors.

4. **Decision-Making:**
   - Given the symmetry of the problem and without any prior data on other players' tendencies, initially choosing a route might rely more on probability.
   - An exploratory choice can provide insight into others' selections. Over repeated rounds, you can adjust strategies based on observations from previous rounds.

5. **First Move Strategy:**
   - In the absence of any historical data or prior rounds to analyze, starting with a less common choice could be an experimental way to minimize costs.
   - Assuming reasonable distribution, choose one of the routes randomly for the first round; observing outcomes can shape future decisions.

Based on this analysis and given no bias towards a particular initial trend among other drivers, I will select: 

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

This choice provides a foundation to see how many others might be selecting this route, and adapt in succeeding rounds accordingly.

Round 2:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 130.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 6 agents
        O-R-D: 12 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision for this round, let's analyze the information we have from Round 1 and strategize accordingly.

1. **Understanding the Costs:**
   - Route O-L-D cost depends on the number of agents choosing it: \( \text{cost} = 10X + 210 \)
   - Route O-R-D cost also depends on the number of agents choosing it: \( \text{cost} = 210 + 10Y \)

2. **Round 1 Recap:**
   - You chose O-L-D.
   - There were 6 agents on O-L-D.
   - There were 12 agents on O-R-D.
   - Your payoff was 130.

3. **Calculating Costs for Round 1:**
   - The cost for choosing O-L-D was \( 10 \times 6 + 210 = 270 \).
   - The cost for choosing O-R-D was \( 210 + 10 \times 12 = 330 \).
   - Your payoff of 130 confirms: \( 400 - 270 = 130 \).

4. **Observations:**
   - Route O-L-D had fewer agents (6) compared to O-R-D (12) in Round 1.
   - O-R-D was more costly, indicating a higher number of drivers.
  
5. **Strategizing for Current Round:**
   - The goal is to minimize travel cost and maximize payoff.
   - It seems O-L-D might attract fewer agents again, but this is uncertain as other participants might adapt.
   - If a similar distribution occurs, choosing O-L-D could again lead to a lower cost.
   - If many drivers switch to O-L-D this round, O-R-D might become cheaper.

6. **Decision:**
   - Given the high number of agents on O-R-D in Round 1, it might remain costly if a similar pattern follows.
   - However, participants might adjust their strategy and choose O-L-D, increasing its cost.
   - Since payoff maximization relies on opting for the cheaper route, observing trends might suggest staying with O-L-D if it continues to attract fewer participants.

Given this analysis, the cautious choice would be to **stick with route O-L-D**, as it was less popular previously and likely remains a lower-cost option unless a significant shift in strategy occurs among other drivers.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 3:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 130.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 6 agents
        O-R-D: 12 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 18 agents
        O-R-D: 0 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide which route to choose in the upcoming round, let's analyze the outcomes from the previous rounds:

### Round 1 Analysis:
- You chose **O-L-D** (cost functions: **10X + 210**).
- 6 agents (including you) chose this route.
- Your calculated travel cost = 10 * 6 + 210 = 270.
- Your payoff = Endowment - Travel Cost = 400 - 270 = 130.

The choice of O-L-D led to a moderate number of agents, resulting in a higher travel cost than the fixed cost segment of 210, resulting in a lower payoff.

### Round 2 Analysis:
- You chose **O-L-D** again.
- 18 agents chose this route.
- Your calculated travel cost = 10 * 18 + 210 = 390.
- Your payoff = 400 - 390 = 10.

All 18 drivers selecting the O-L-D route maximized the cost with a significant decrease in payoff, leaving virtually no points from the endowment after costs.

### Decision Considerations:
1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - The travel cost is highly variable as it depends on the number of agents on this route.
   - High agent occupancy drastically increases travel cost.

2. **Route O-R-D:**
   - The cost remains somewhat stable since one segment has a fixed cost and is independent of the number of agents on this route.
   - This route currently seems underutilized based on past data.

### Decision:
Given the variability and disappointment in payoffs when choosing O-L-D, and considering the costly past choices with this route as more agents joined, choosing **O-R-D** minimizes risk since its overall cost structure is more predictable with the same cost structure applying to all users. This is particularly relevant given last round's outcomes with everyone opting for O-L-D, signaling an opportunity to exploit the less used path for an optimal payoff. 

Thus, choosing **O-R-D** should balance the load and likely minimize your costs, increasing the payoff opportunity.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 4:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 130.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 6 agents
        O-R-D: 12 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 18 agents
        O-R-D: 0 agents

Round 3:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 0 agents
        O-R-D: 18 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an optimal decision for which route to choose, let's analyze the previous rounds and derive a strategy:

1. **Understanding Previous Payoffs:**
   - **Round 1:** I chose route O-L-D with a payoff of 130. This implies my travel cost was 400 - 130 = 270. Given 6 agents took O-L-D, the cost was (10 * 6) + 210 = 270, confirming this calculation.
   - **Round 2:** I again chose route O-L-D but ended with a very low payoff of 10. This suggests a travel cost of 390, calculated as (10 * 18) + 210 = 390, when all agents took O-L-D.
   - **Round 3:** I switched to O-R-D, resulting in a payoff of 10. Here, with all agents choosing O-R-D, the cost was 210 + (10 * 18) = 390, matching my low payoff.

2. **Behavioral Observation:**
   - High crowding on one route severely impacts the payoff due to the variable cost component.
   - Both routes are dic-centric depending on where most participants choose to go. Both outcomes resulted in a 390 cost when crowded, irrespective of the route.
   - Agents tend to shift routes drastically, as seen in the shift from Round 2 to Round 3 (0 agents on O-L-D vs. 18 agents).

3. **Strategic Decision:**
   - Choosing the least crowded route is preferable to minimize the variable cost.
   - A balanced distribution might result in a payoff closer to the maximum possible.
   - Based on the past pattern, a drastic agent shift might occur after observing high crowding in Round 3.

4. **Predicted Movements and Decision:**
   - Given past behavior, it is possible that many agents will switch to O-L-D after seeing that all were on O-R-D in Round 3.
   - To capitalize on this potential shift, selecting O-R-D could be advantageous, expecting fewer agents to choose it.

With this analysis, my decision for the next round is to choose the route O-R-D in hope of a better distribution of agents. 

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 5:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 130.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 6 agents
        O-R-D: 12 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 18 agents
        O-R-D: 0 agents

Round 3:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 0 agents
        O-R-D: 18 agents

Round 4:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 140.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 13 agents
        O-R-D: 5 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision for the next round, let's analyze the patterns from the previous rounds:

1. **Observations from Previous Rounds:**
   - **Round 1:** You chose O-L-D with 6 agents and received a payoff of 130.
   - **Round 2:** You chose O-L-D with 18 agents and received a low payoff of 10. This suggests that when too many agents choose O-L-D, the cost becomes very high.
   - **Round 3:** You switched to O-R-D with 18 agents and again received a low payoff of 10. This indicates that having all agents on O-R-D also leads to high cost.
   - **Round 4:** You chose O-R-D while 5 agents were on the same route, receiving a higher payoff of 140, which suggests a better cost distribution was achieved with fewer agents on that route.

2. **Analysis:**
   - When more agents choose the same route, the cost associated with variable segments (O-L and R-D) tends to increase, leading to lower payoffs.
   - The aim should be to select the route that likely has fewer agents to balance both routes and minimize costs.
   - Historically, O-R-D with fewer agents (as in Round 4) provided a higher payoff. 
   
3. **Strategy Going Forward:**
   - Since the last round produced a better payoff with O-R-D when fewer agents were sharing the route, it may be advantageous to continue with O-R-D, particularly if you anticipate that other players might choose O-L-D based on previous losses with O-R-D.
   - However, predicting exactly how many will choose the same route can be tricky. Balancing the number in each route might require guessing opponent's decisions or testing based on previous trends.

4. **Decision:**
   - Given the most recent payoff was obtained with fewer people on O-R-D, my choice for the next round is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 6:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 130.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 6 agents
        O-R-D: 12 agents

- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 18 agents
        O-R-D: 0 agents

Round 3:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 0 agents
        O-R-D: 18 agents

Round 4:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 140.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 13 agents
        O-R-D: 5 agents

Round 5:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 60.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 5 agents
        O-R-D: 13 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision for the next round, we should analyze the previous rounds and observe patterns in agent behavior and resultant payoffs. Let's break it down:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Chose O-L-D: Payoff = 130
   - Distribution: O-L-D: 6 agents, O-R-D: 12 agents
   - Cost for O-L-D = 10*6 + 210 = 270. Payoff = 400 - 270 = 130.
   - O-R-D choice cost would have been 210 + 10*12 = 330, giving a payoff of 70.

2. **Round 2:**
   - Chose O-L-D: Payoff = 10
   - Distribution: O-L-D: 18 agents, O-R-D: 0 agents
   - Cost for O-L-D = 10*18 + 210 = 390. Payoff = 400 - 390 = 10.

3. **Round 3:**
   - Chose O-R-D: Payoff = 10
   - Distribution: O-L-D: 0 agents, O-R-D: 18 agents
   - Cost for O-R-D = 210 + 10*18 = 390. Payoff = 400 - 390 = 10.

4. **Round 4:**
   - Chose O-R-D: Payoff = 140
   - Distribution: O-L-D: 13 agents, O-R-D: 5 agents
   - Cost for O-R-D = 210 + 10*5 = 260. Payoff = 400 - 260 = 140.
   - O-L-D choice would have been 10*13 + 210 = 340, giving a payoff of 60.

5. **Round 5:**
   - Chose O-R-D: Payoff = 60
   - Distribution: O-L-D: 5 agents, O-R-D: 13 agents
   - Cost for O-R-D = 210 + 10*13 = 340. Payoff = 400 - 340 = 60.
   - O-L-D choice would have been 10*5 + 210 = 260, giving a payoff of 140.

**Analysis:**
- The highest payoffs were received when the chosen route had fewer individuals. 
- Payoffs fluctuate based on agents’ distribution between the routes.
- A strategy can be attempting to intuit the less popular choice to minimize cost.

**Decision Considerations:**
- In the past few rounds, the distribution shifted between all players choosing a single route and a slightly more even distribution (5 vs. 13).
- O-R-D seems to be a popular choice in rounds with less variability.

**Strategy for Next Round:**
Given that the payoff for O-L-D would have been higher in round 5, and O-R-D was less rewarding when overloaded, there might be an emerging switch in preference back to O-L-D.

Therefore, **considering potential tendencies of other agents and aiming to maximize payoff, my choice will be:**

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```


Round 7:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 130.
- The number of agents on each route was:

        O-L-D: 13 agents
        O-R-D: 5 agents

Round 5:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 60.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 5 agents
        O-R-D: 13 agents

Round 6:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 70.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 12 agents
        O-R-D: 6 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision about which route to choose for the next round, we need to analyze the pattern from previous rounds and calculate expected costs based on the number of agents on each route:

1. **Identify Patterns:**
   - When most agents choose one route, it severely impacts the remaining capacity and increases costs on that route.
   - A balanced distribution of agents between the routes minimizes the travel cost for those routes.
   - Your goal is to choose a route that might attract fewer agents, therefore reducing your cost and maximizing your payoff.

2. **Observe Trends:**
   - There were instances where everyone chose one route (Round 2: O-L-D, Round 3: O-R-D), leading to minimal payoff.
   - In balanced rounds (Round 1, Round 4), payoffs were higher.

3. **Calculation of Payoffs:**
   - Route O-L-D: Cost = 10X + 210
   - Route O-R-D: Cost = 210 + 10Y
   - Payoff = 400 - Travel Cost

4. **Strategic Choice:**
   - Overall trend suggests agents might gravitate towards the route they believe others will avoid, trying to outsmart the pattern.
   - Choose the route that seems less favorable based on recent decisions to maximize personal payoff.

5. **Decision for Next Round:**
   - Recent rounds show fluctuations between high and low participants on each route, with the last being more balanced.
   - Predicting a shift, consider choosing the route that was less crowded last time.

Based on these observations, I would choose route 'O-L-D', anticipating fewer agents might choose it following the pattern from Round 6.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 130.

- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 5 agents
        O-R-D: 13 agents

Round 6:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 70.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 12 agents
        O-R-D: 6 agents

Round 7:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 130.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 6 agents
        O-R-D: 12 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a rational decision in choosing a route, let's analyze the past rounds:

1. **Rounds with maximum payoffs**:
   - Round 1 and Round 7 resulted in the same choice 'O-L-D', with 6 agents on 'O-L-D' and 12 agents on 'O-R-D'. This route provided a payoff of 130.
   - Round 4 also resulted in a higher payoff with the choice 'O-R-D', where 13 agents chose 'O-L-D' and 5 agents chose 'O-R-D'. This gave a payoff of 140.

2. **Rounds with low payoffs**:
   - Round 2 had all 18 agents choosing 'O-L-D', resulting in a payoff of 10. Clearly, 'O-L-D' is not ideal if many agents choose it.
   - Round 3 had all 18 agents choosing 'O-R-D', also resulting in a payoff of 10. 'O-R-D' isn't ideal if overcrowded either.

3. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Alternate rounds suggest an attempting balance between the two routes. Initially, 'O-L-D' was preferred by fewer agents, then 'O-R-D' in the subsequent rounds.
   - Rounds 1 and 7 repeating the same ratio 6/12 for 'O-L-D'/'O-R-D' have shown good consistency for the route 'O-L-D'.
   - Consistently switching between routes doesn't seem beneficial as the payoffs varied widely. However, staying with 'O-L-D' in more balanced scenarios has shown better results.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, when fewer people choose 'O-L-D', it tends to offer higher payoffs, and historically, it has had the potential for good payoffs unless overcrowded.
   - Considering the information from the summary and the need to avoid routes everyone else might predictably choose, it seems logical to select 'O-L-D' again.

Given this detailed review of the outcomes and patterns, and aiming for a balance while predicting others may continue switching, it would be prudent to choose 'O-L-D'.

Here's the final decision:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 9:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision about the route to choose in the next round, let's analyze the previous rounds:

1. **Assessment of each route's outcomes:**
   - When choosing **O-L-D**: 
     - Round 1: 130 points (6 agents)
     - Round 2: 10 points (18 agents)
     - Round 6: 70 points (12 agents)
     - Round 7: 130 points (6 agents)
     - Round 8: 60 points (13 agents)

   - When choosing **O-R-D**:
     - Round 3: 10 points (18 agents)
     - Round 4: 140 points (5 agents)
     - Round 5: 60 points (13 agents)

2. **Performance comparison:**
   - **O-L-D** seemed favorable in rounds with fewer participants (Rounds 1, 7). When the number of participants was high, the payoff decreased significantly (Round 2).
   - **O-R-D** was profitable with fewer participants (Round 4) but less so when many chose the same route (Rounds 3 and 5).

3. **Pattern recognition:**
   - There appears to be fluctuation in the number of agents choosing each route, possibly indicating some strategic play among participants trying to balance between routes.
   - Historically, both routes have the potential to be profitable, but this depends on the behavior of the other participants.

4. **Recent trends (Rounds 7 and 8):**
   - In the last two rounds, **O-L-D** had an average of 9.5 agents while **O-R-D** averaged 8.5 agents.
   - The payoffs when choosing **O-L-D** weren't maximized when more agents participated than in earlier rounds.

5. **Strategic decision:**
   - Given the history, it seems that balancing the decision based on recent trends could provide better odds. If participants are aiming for the profitability that comes from fewer competitors on a route, choosing the opposite route from the one with fewer agents recently might be wise.

Based on these analyses, choosing **O-R-D** seems strategically viable, given its lower occupancy in the last round, and potential for a higher payoff if fewer agents choose it. 

Therefore, the choice is:

{
  "route": "O-R-D"

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide on a route for the next round, let's analyze the outcomes and the patterns from the previous rounds. 

1. **Outcomes per route**:  
   - Route O-L-D: You've had payoffs ranging from a low of 10 (when all 18 agents chose O-L-D in Round 2) to a high of 130 (when only 6 agents chose O-L-D in Rounds 1 and 7). 
   - Route O-R-D: Payoffs have ranged from 10 (when all 18 agents chose O-R-D in Round 3) to 140 (when only 5 agents chose O-R-D in Round 4).

2. **Patterns and observations**:
   - Generally, when fewer agents choose a route, your payoff tends to be higher. This is due to the increasing cost of segments that depend on the number of users (O-L and R-D).
   - Even distribution between two routes (around 9 agents each) would provide a cost of around 300, leaving a payoff of 100 - this hasn't been observed, perhaps due to agents reacting to past rounds trying to avoid crowded routes.

3. **Previous round analysis**:
   - In Round 9, you chose O-R-D, and 14 agents did the same resulting in a low payoff (50 points).
   - Rounds 1 and 7 had similar outcomes where choosing O-L-D resulted in 130 payoff with 6 agents choosing it.

4. **Strategy Proposal**:
   - It seems like many agents either react to the previous round's congested route by switching, or they attempt to predict others' moves.
   - Based on history, many agents may switch from a congested route to the less congested one and vice versa.
   - Since routes can fluctuate in popularity drastically due to other agents' decision-making behaviors, a strategic approach this time would be to choose the opposite of the heavily occupied Round 9 (O-R-D: 14 agents). Hence, O-L-D could potentially have fewer agents this round, offering a better payoff.

Thus, after considering the trends from the previous rounds, a strategic choice for the next round would be to go with route **O-L-D**.
