System Message:

You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Round 1:
Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision about which route to choose, let's analyze the given traffic network and costs step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Routes and Costs**:
   - Route 'O-L-D': The cost is dependent on the number of drivers, \(X\), choosing this route as \(10X + 210\).
   - Route 'O-R-D': The cost is dependent on the number of drivers, \(Y\), choosing this route as \(210 + 10Y\).

2. **Endowment and Objective**:
   - Each driver receives an endowment of 400 points per round.
   - The goal is to minimize travel cost and thus maximize payoff, which is calculated as the endowment minus travel cost.

3. **Cost Dynamics**:
   - The segment O-L is affected by \(X\), and R-D is affected by \(Y\).
   - Fixed Costs: L-D and O-R segments each have a fixed cost of 210.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - If a route is chosen by fewer participants, the variable cost component will be lower, leading to a potentially higher payoff.
   - In an equilibrium where drivers minimize their own costs, it's crucial to predict the behavior of other drivers regarding route choice.

5. **Decision Making**:
   - Without prior knowledge of other drivers’ decisions, we aim to balance the load to minimize cost, leading to an optimal Nash Equilibrium in theory.
   - Initially, assuming that all routes might be chosen equally, the cost for each can be calculated assuming \(X\approx Y\approx\frac{total\_drivers}{2}=9\):
     - Cost of Route 'O-L-D': \(10 \times 9 + 210 = 300\)
     - Cost of Route 'O-R-D': \(210 + 10 \times 9 = 300\)

6. **Initial Choice Strategy**:
   - Given the symmetry and equal possibility of choice, it would be rational to initially pick either route.
   - However, considering typical human behavior in similar games, if most participate in strategic balance, a slight tilt can occur.
   - A rational approach is starting potentially by choosing a less obvious route to probe the population distribution, which in real scenarios may equate to 'O-R-D', perferring slightly deviated predictions.

Therefore, with considerations above, I would choose:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 2:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 60.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 5 agents
        O-R-D: 13 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision regarding which route to choose, let's analyze the information from the previous round and the characteristics of each route.

### Given Data from Round 1:
- **Your Choice:** O-R-D
- **Your Payoff:** 60 points
- **Number of Agents:**
  - O-L-D: 5 agents
  - O-R-D: 13 agents

### Cost Calculation:
1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost = 10 * X + 210
   - With 5 agents: Cost = 10 * 5 + 210 = 260

2. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost = 210 + 10 * Y
   - With 13 agents: Cost = 210 + 10 * 13 = 340

### Payoff Determination:
- Your endowment is 400 points.
- Payoff = Endowment - Cost

In Round 1, you chose O-R-D which had a cost of 340, resulting in a payoff of 60. Since other drivers on O-R-D paid higher due to the large number having chosen that route, your intuition might be to consider the opposite route given the costs involved.

### Strategy Move:
Considering the above analysis, choosing the route with fewer drivers might yield a better payoff due to a lower cost being equated with fewer drivers on that route.

- **Route O-L-D** had 5 agents, resulting in a lower cost for them.

### Decision:
Based on the analysis and considering cost efficiency, I will choose route O-L-D for the next round to potentially achieve a better payoff.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 3:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 60.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 5 agents
        O-R-D: 13 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 18 agents
        O-R-D: 0 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide which route to choose in the next round, let's analyze the outcomes of the previous rounds:

1. **Round 1 Analysis:**
   - Chose route O-R-D.
   - 13 agents were on route O-R-D.
   - Payoff was 60.
   - Cost calculation: 
     - Travel cost = 210 (fixed) + 10 * 13 = 210 + 130 = 340.
     - Payoff = 400 (endowment) - 340 = 60.
   - Observation: High congestion on O-R-D due to 13 agents, resulting in a high variable cost.

2. **Round 2 Analysis:**
   - Chose route O-L-D.
   - 18 agents were on route O-L-D.
   - Payoff was 10.
   - Cost calculation:
     - Travel cost = 10 * 18 + 210 = 180 + 210 = 390.
     - Payoff = 400 (endowment) - 390 = 10.
   - Observation: Complete congestion on O-L-D, leading to a very high cost.

**Strategy for Next Round:**
- Based on outcomes from previous rounds, route O-L-D had complete congestion in Round 2, leading to extremely high costs. In contrast, route O-R-D seemed less congested in Round 1 compared to Round 2's O-L-D.
- Choosing route O-R-D may likely be a better choice if fewer agents choose it, leading to a lower cost than the completely congested O-L-D.

Given this reasoning, I will choose route O-R-D for the next round to see if it is less congested than O-L-D.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 4:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 60.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 5 agents
        O-R-D: 13 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 18 agents
        O-R-D: 0 agents

Round 3:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 30.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 2 agents
        O-R-D: 16 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision for the next round, let’s analyze the given data from the previous rounds:

1. **Round 1:**
   - **Route Chosen:** O-R-D
   - **Payoff:** 60
   - **Cost Calculation:**
     - Cost for O-R-D: \(210 + 10 \times 13 = 340\)
     - Endowment – Cost: \(400 - 340 = 60\)
   - **Agents Distribution:** O-L-D: 5, O-R-D: 13

2. **Round 2:**
   - **Route Chosen:** O-L-D
   - **Payoff:** 10
   - **Cost Calculation:**
     - Cost for O-L-D: \(10 \times 18 + 210 = 390\)
     - Endowment – Cost: \(400 - 390 = 10\)
   - **Agents Distribution:** O-L-D: 18, O-R-D: 0

3. **Round 3:**
   - **Route Chosen:** O-R-D
   - **Payoff:** 30
   - **Cost Calculation:**
     - Cost for O-R-D: \(210 + 10 \times 16 = 370\)
     - Endowment – Cost: \(400 - 370 = 30\)
   - **Agents Distribution:** O-L-D: 2, O-R-D: 16

From the analysis:

- **Route O-R-D:** Provides better payoff when there is a lower number of other participants choosing this route, as seen in Round 1 compared to Round 3.
- **Route O-L-D:** Had low payoff when all agents chose this route, as seen in Round 2.

**Strategy Consideration:**

The critical factor is estimating how many agents will choose each route in the next round. Based on the provided information:
- O-R-D often has a larger number of participants, causing higher costs.
- The payoff decreases significantly on both routes when a large number of participants choose the same route.

**Decision:**

To maximize the payoff, choosing the route with fewer anticipated participants is crucial. Given the observed behavior in previous rounds, participants might follow patterns or respond to the previous outcomes similarly.

In the previous round, many agents moved from O-L-D to O-R-D.

The trend suggests that after a complete saturation of O-L-D, players might distribute more evenly or revert to O-L-D assuming fewer agents will choose it again.

Considering these factors, the next strategic choice is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 5:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 60.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 5 agents
        O-R-D: 13 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 18 agents
        O-R-D: 0 agents

Round 3:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 30.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 2 agents
        O-R-D: 16 agents

Round 4:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 40.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 15 agents
        O-R-D: 3 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To determine which route to choose in the next round, let's analyze the information from the previous rounds and the conditions of the game:

1. **Endowment and Cost Structure:**
   - Each round, you receive an endowment of 400 points. Your goal is to minimize your travel costs to maximize your payoff.
   - Route costs are calculated as follows:
     - **O-L-D**: Cost = 10X + 210, where X is the number of agents choosing O-L-D.
     - **O-R-D**: Cost = 210 + 10Y, where Y is the number of agents choosing O-R-D.

2. **Previous Rounds Analysis:**
   - **Round 1:**
     - Chose O-R-D, received payoff of 60.
     - O-L-D had 5 agents, O-R-D had 13 agents.
     - Cost for O-R-D was 340 (400 - 60 payoff).
   - **Round 2:**
     - Chose O-L-D, received payoff of 10.
     - O-L-D had 18 agents, O-R-D had 0 agents.
     - Cost for O-L-D was 390 (400 - 10 payoff).
   - **Round 3:**
     - Chose O-R-D, received payoff of 30.
     - O-L-D had 2 agents, O-R-D had 16 agents.
     - Cost for O-R-D was 370 (400 - 30 payoff).
   - **Round 4:**
     - Chose O-L-D, received payoff of 40.
     - O-L-D had 15 agents, O-R-D had 3 agents.
     - Cost for O-L-D was 360 (400 - 40 payoff).

3. **Trends and Observations:**
   - Payoffs tend to be higher when choosing O-R-D when fewer participants are on O-R-D.
   - Conversely, large numbers on O-L-D increase costs significantly due to the 10X multiplier.
   - Other agents seem to shift routes, possibly reacting similarly to previous outcomes, leading to uncertainty in the distribution on each route.

4. **Strategic Decision:**
   - If the previous pattern holds (less load on O-R-D when many choose O-L-D), there might be a payoff advantage to choosing O-R-D when most agents are choosing O-L-D.
   - Since Round 4 saw a very high number of agents on O-L-D, a potential strategic switch might be to consider O-R-D in anticipation they may switch back to O-R-D.

Considering these points, choosing route O-R-D for the next round seems strategically sound, hoping fewer agents will be on this route due to a possible shift from the prior round's outcome on O-L-D.

Round 6:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 60.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 5 agents
        O-R-D: 13 agents

Round 3:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 30.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 2 agents
        O-R-D: 16 agents

Round 4:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 40.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 15 agents
        O-R-D: 3 agents

Round 5:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 40.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 3 agents
        O-R-D: 15 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide which route to choose in the next round, let's analyze the data we have from previous rounds:

1. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Route O-L-D: Cost = 10X + 210
   - Route O-R-D: Cost = 210 + 10Y

2. **Understanding Payoffs**:
   - Higher payoffs indicate lower costs, thus fewer people on your chosen route minimize cost influenced by other drivers.
   
3. **Previous Rounds Insights**:
   - **Round 1 (O-R-D)**: 13 agents on O-R-D resulted in a payoff of 60. Implies: Cost = 340, 18 total participants.
   - **Round 2 (O-L-D)**: 18 agents resulted in a payoff of 10. Implies: Cost = 390, this confirms congested traffic on selected route drastically reduces payoff.
   - **Round 3 (O-R-D)**: 16 agents on O-R-D resulted in a payoff of 30. Implies: Cost = 370.
   - **Round 4 (O-L-D)**: 15 agents on O-L-D, better payoff of 40. Implies: Cost = 360.
   - **Round 5 (O-R-D)**: 15 agents on O-R-D also resulted in a better payoff of 40. Implies: Cost = 360.

4. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - High participation on chosen routes tends to increase cost hence reduction in payoff.
   - When fewer agents choose the same route as you, costs decrease, increasing payoff.
   
5. **Behavioral Trend**: 
   - Agents seem cyclic in their choice, likely shifting based on previously high congestion.
   - Rounds with fewer agents on chosen route have yielded higher payoffs.

6. **Decision Strategy**:
   - Assuming others might switch as they've seen trends similar to ours, O-R-D has seen fluctuating participation.
   - Opting for a less congested route might be more beneficial, seemingly the trend suggests fewer agents switch between rounds.

Given this analysis, I would strategically choose route **O-L-D** for potentially fewer shared drivers based on predictable fluctuations and agent behavior.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a strategic decision for the next round, let's analyze the data from the previous rounds and determine the best course of action:

1. **Previous Round Analysis**: 
   - When the route O-L-D has fewer agents, choosing it has resulted in higher payoffs. For instance, in Round 6 with 13 agents on O-L-D and 5 on O-R-D, choosing O-L-D resulted in a payoff of 60. In contrast, in rounds where O-L-D had more agents, the payoff dropped significantly.
   - Similarly, when O-R-D has fewer agents, choosing it has resulted in relatively higher payoffs. For instance, in Round 1 with 5 agents on O-L-D and 13 on O-R-D, a choice of O-R-D resulted in a payoff of 60.

2. **Identifying Patterns**:
   - The distribution of agents seems to oscillate between the routes, as players adjust their strategies based on previous outcomes.
   - It's crucial to balance between both routes, predicting that other players might switch routes to achieve better payoffs, thereby influencing the number of agents on each route.

3. **Strategic Decision for Next Round**:
   - Based on the observed pattern, since many agents were on O-L-D in the most recent rounds 4 and 6, it is probable that more players might switch to O-R-D to try to achieve better payoffs.
   - Therefore, choosing route O-R-D again could potentially result in fewer total participants on that route, thus leading to a lower total cost.

A strategic decision for the next round would be to choose route O-R-D.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision on the next route, let's analyze the previous rounds and focus on maximizing the payoff by minimizing travel costs. 

### Reviewing Past Rounds:
1. **Round 1**: Chose O-R-D, payoff 60 (O-L-D: 5, O-R-D: 13)
   - High number of agents on O-R-D led to a moderate payoff.
   
2. **Round 2**: Chose O-L-D, payoff 10 (O-L-D: 18, O-R-D: 0)
   - All agents chose O-L-D, leading to a minimal payoff.

3. **Round 3**: Chose O-R-D, payoff 30 (O-L-D: 2, O-R-D: 16)
   - Extremely high traffic on O-R-D resulted in low payoff.

4. **Round 4**: Chose O-L-D, payoff 40 (O-L-D: 15, O-R-D: 3)
   - High O-L-D traffic reduced payoff.

5. **Round 5**: Chose O-R-D, payoff 40 (O-L-D: 3, O-R-D: 15)
   - Heavy traffic on O-R-D decreased payoff.

6. **Round 6**: Chose O-L-D, payoff 60 (O-L-D: 13, O-R-D: 5)
   - Moderate traffic on O-L-D allowed for higher payoff.

7. **Round 7**: Chose O-R-D, payoff 80 (O-L-D: 7, O-R-D: 11)
   - Balanced distribution provided the highest payoff observed.

### Considerations:
- In rounds with many agents on O-R-D, payoffs were generally lower.
- A high number of agents choosing O-L-D also led to lower payoffs.
- Round 7 had the most balanced distribution and the highest payoff.
- Generally, when traffic is much heavier on one route, the other route tends to yield better payoff.

### Strategy:
- Look for a balance where neither route is heavily favored by participants.
- Given recent rounds, the agent population seems to oscillate. Aiming for a route with expected lower traffic could be advantageous.

### Decision:
Based on these observations, aiming for the less crowded route enhances the chance of a higher payoff. Assuming participants tend to flock towards the previously balanced but now more utilized route (O-R-D), switching back to O-L-D might yield better results if they gravitate towards O-R-D.

Thus, choose:
```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To determine which route to choose for the next round, let's analyze the data from the previous rounds and see if we can identify any patterns or strategies that could help predict the distribution of drivers on each route.

### Analysis:

1. **Round Analysis**:
   - **Rounds 1, 3, 5, 7**: These rounds had more agents choosing route O-R-D, resulting in higher costs for those who took this route.
   - **Rounds 2, 4, 6, 8**: These rounds had more agents choosing route O-L-D, leading to higher costs for those who took this route.

2. **Payoff Overview**:
   - The highest payoffs were in Rounds 7 and 8, with 80 points when the chosen route had fewer agents compared to the other.
   - Typically, a more balanced distribution of agents between the routes leads to better payoffs (e.g., Rounds 6 and 8).

3. **Strategy Consideration**:
   - Alternating between the two routes has sometimes resulted in encountering a significantly lower number of agents on a chosen route.
   - Observing the recent pattern, after one round sees a higher number on a route, the next often sees a switch.
   
4. **Predictive Consideration**:
    - Historically, after more agents chose O-L-D in Round 8 and fewer agents chose O-R-D, it might indicate that in the next round, more agents could choose O-L-D to balance previous distribution, creating a potential opportunity on O-R-D.

### Decision:

Considering the historical switching pattern and the fact that the last round saw more drivers on O-L-D, there's a chance that O-R-D might be less popular in the upcoming round. Based on these observations, I'll choose:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision for Round 10, let's analyze the results from previous rounds:

1. **Trend Observation**:
   - Route O-R-D seems to yield higher payoffs when fewer agents choose it. For example, in Round 7, you chose O-R-D when 11 others did too, and you received a payoff of 80 — your highest payoff yet for choosing that route.
   - Route O-L-D has also produced high payoffs when fewer agents chose it. In Round 8, when 11 agents chose it, you also received a payoff of 80.

2. **High Payoff Conditions**:
   - Choosing route O-R-D when about 11-13 agents are on it tends to give moderate to high payoffs.
   - Choosing route O-L-D when about 11 agents prefer it grants a similarly higher payoff.

3. **Balance Strategy**:
   - Given your mix of results, trying to predict the behavior of other agents is crucial. The goal is to be on the less crowded route.
   - However, from recent rounds, there seems to be a tendency for drivers to shift based on past density, creating a cycle.
   - Just recently, Round 9 saw a higher concentration on Route O-R-D. 

4. **Anticipated Outcome**:
   - Based on the cyclical trends, drivers who were on O-R-D might shift towards O-L-D due to the overcrowding.
   - Thus, there's some indication that O-L-D might attract more drivers than O-R-D in the upcoming round.

5. **Decision**:
   - Aiming for higher payoff, it might be strategic this time to choose the lesser occupied route. Given the likelihood of drivers shifting back to O-L-D, choosing O-R-D might be advantageous if fewer drivers do.

Based on this analysis, the optimal choice appears to be:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision for the next round, let's analyze the previous rounds to determine a potential pattern or strategy that could maximize my payoff. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Payoff Analysis:**
   - The highest payoff is achieved when the travel cost is minimized relative to the 400-point endowment.
   - The payoffs I received in the previous rounds are as follows: 60, 10, 30, 40, 40, 60, 80, 80, 60, and 90.
   - The highest payoffs (80 and 90) were achieved in rounds 7, 8, and 10.

2. **Agent Distribution:**
   - In round 7: 7 agents on route O-L-D, 11 agents on route O-R-D.
   - In round 8: 11 agents on route O-L-D, 7 agents on route O-R-D.
   - In round 10: 8 agents on route O-L-D, 10 agents on route O-R-D.

3. **Route Choice Impact:**
   - When I chose O-R-D in round 10, there were fewer total agents (10) compared to other rounds on the same route, resulting in a payoff of 90.
   - Choosing the route with fewer agents generally minimizes cost due to less congestion, a principle derived from the cost structure: segments O-L and R-D are cheaper with fewer users.

4. **Pattern Observation:**
   - Alternating between routes can potentially reduce the chance of congestion as the choice becomes less predictable.
   - In rounds with a near-even distribution or fewer agents on the chosen route, higher payoffs are observed.

5. **Decision for Next Round:**
   - Since I chose O-R-D in round 10 and received a high payoff, and observing previous outcomes, switching might introduce less congestion on the previously chosen route.
   - Therefore, choosing `O-L-D` might potentially distribute the load better, increasing the chance of replicating higher payoffs.

Given this analysis, my choice for the next round will be to switch to the route with potentially lower congestion as experienced in the past advantageous rounds:

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
Based on the summary of previous rounds, I'll make a decision on which route to choose for the next round. Let's analyze the data:

1. **Payoff Comparison:** Each route choice resulted in different payoffs depending on the distribution of agents between the routes.
  
2. **Route O-R-D Analysis:**
   - Round 1: Chose O-R-D, payoff was 60 (13 agents on O-R-D)
   - Round 3: Chose O-R-D, payoff was 30 (16 agents on O-R-D)
   - Round 5: Chose O-R-D, payoff was 40 (15 agents on O-R-D)
   - Round 7: Chose O-R-D, payoff was 80 (11 agents on O-R-D)
   - Round 9: Chose O-R-D, payoff was 60 (13 agents on O-R-D)
   - Round 10: Chose O-R-D, payoff was 90 (10 agents on O-R-D)

3. **Route O-L-D Analysis:**
   - Round 2: Chose O-L-D, payoff was 10 (18 agents on O-L-D)
   - Round 4: Chose O-L-D, payoff was 40 (15 agents on O-L-D)
   - Round 6: Chose O-L-D, payoff was 60 (13 agents on O-L-D)
   - Round 8: Chose O-L-D, payoff was 80 (11 agents on O-L-D)
   - Round 11: Chose O-L-D, payoff was 120 (7 agents on O-L-D)

4. **Observations:**
   - Higher payoffs often occur when fewer agents choose the same route.
   - Notably, Round 11, where I chose O-L-D, resulted in a payoff of 120 when there were 7 agents on O-L-D, suggesting a very favorable outcome when fewer people chose that route.

5. **Strategic Conclusion:**
   - It is advantageous to select a route less chosen by others to minimize the variable cost component.
   - Observing the recent rounds, participants seem to have alternated their choices between the two routes, with some trend of equilibrating agent numbers. However, recent higher payoffs on O-L-D indicate potential under-selection by others.

Based on the current analysis, choosing route **O-L-D** again might provide a higher payoff if the number of agents choosing this route remains low or lower compared to the alternative. I'll go with this strategy in the next round.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide on the optimal route for the next round, let's analyze the provided information and identify any patterns or strategies:

1. **Objective:** Maximize payoff by minimizing travel costs, which is determined by the number of agents choosing the same segments.

2. **Previous Outcomes:**
   - When choosing **O-R-D**:
     - High payoff (90) when the number of agents on **O-R-D** was 10 (Round 10).
     - Medium payoffs (60, 80) when the number of agents ranged from 11 to 13.
     - Poorer payoffs (30, 40) when 15 or 16 agents chose the same route.

   - When choosing **O-L-D**:
     - Highest payoff (120) was achieved when 7 agents were on **O-L-D** (Round 11).
     - Medium payoffs (90, 80, 60) occurred with a range of 10 to 13 agents.
     - Poor payoff (10) when all agents (18) chose **O-L-D**.

3. **Patterns:**
   - A payoff of 90 or higher is typically achieved when the chosen route has around 8 to 10 agents.
   - Route **O-R-D** seems riskier with payoffs fluctuating more significantly compared to **O-L-D**.
   - A balance tends to give higher payoffs, where both routes are nearly equally chosen (or close to a 10-8 split).

4. **Prediction for Next Round**: 
   - If recent rounds (11 and 12) saw many choosing **O-L-D**, there might be a trend reversal where drivers switch to **O-R-D**.
   - Conversely, the mixed outcomes suggest uncertainty, and many might still lean towards the safer **O-L-D**.
   - Observing that **O-L-D** had two significantly higher payoffs recently (120 and 90), it might slightly deter drivers from returning to it until they observe more people on the alternative route.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Choosing **O-R-D** has just provided a higher return (90) compared to **O-L-D** recently (Rounds 10 and 12) and gives a good balance if other drivers switch back to spreading more evenly.

Considering these patterns and the behavior in the previous rounds, the logical decision would be:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Here, the expected strategic play is to capitalize on potential overflows switching to **O-L-D**, providing an opportunity to benefit from a more balanced and less congested **O-R-D**.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision for the next route selection, let's analyze the previous rounds in terms of payoffs and the number of agents on each route.

1. **High Payoffs and Agent Balance:**
   - Round 10: Chose O-R-D with 10 agents on O-R-D and received a payoff of 90.
   - Round 11: Chose O-L-D with 7 agents on O-L-D and received a payoff of 120.
   - Round 13: Chose O-R-D with both routes having 9 agents and received a payoff of 100.

2. **Agent Tendency Observations:**
   - When the agents were evenly split (9 on each route), the payoff was quite high (Round 13).
   - O-R-D tends to have more agents than O-L-D in most rounds which generally leads to lower payoff for those rounds when choosing O-R-D.

3. **Recent Patterns/Trends:**
   - Switching routes when too many agents accumulate on one route seems beneficial.
   - High payoff was achieved when there were fewer agents on the selected route or the traffic was more evenly distributed.

4. **Strategic Choice:**
   - Since previous high rewards were achieved when routes were balanced or choosing the route with fewer agents, it may be strategic to choose the route that is less crowded based on trends or prior rounds.

Looking at this analysis, in the next round, it seems beneficial to choose the route with historically fewer agents or the one that brings balance. Given recent high payoffs with 7-10 agents on each route, I will choose the route that has shown better outcomes with managed congestion.

**Decision:** Given the analysis, I will choose route `O-R-D` expecting that it might be less crowded in this round or at least evenly distributed.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision in this context, let's analyze the outcomes from the previous rounds with a focus on our payoffs and the distribution of agents on each route.

### Analysis of Previous Rounds:

1. **Rounds with Route O-R-D:**
   - Round 1: Payoff = 60 (13 agents) 
   - Round 3: Payoff = 30 (16 agents)
   - Round 5: Payoff = 40 (15 agents)
   - Round 7: Payoff = 80 (11 agents)
   - Round 9: Payoff = 60 (13 agents)
   - Round 10: Payoff = 90 (10 agents)
   - Round 13: Payoff = 100 (9 agents)
   - Round 14: Payoff = 100 (9 agents)

2. **Rounds with Route O-L-D:**
   - Round 2: Payoff = 10 (18 agents)
   - Round 4: Payoff = 40 (15 agents)
   - Round 6: Payoff = 60 (13 agents)
   - Round 8: Payoff = 80 (11 agents)
   - Round 11: Payoff = 120 (7 agents)
   - Round 12: Payoff = 90 (10 agents)

### Observations:
- **Route O-R-D**:
  - Lower costs (higher payoffs) were achieved when fewer agents chose this route.
  - Rounds 13 and 14 gave a significantly higher payoff, where the distribution was balanced between routes (9 agents each).

- **Route O-L-D**:
  - Similarly, the payoffs improved significantly when fewer agents chose this route.
  - Round 11 provided the highest payoff when this route had only 7 agents while 11 agents chose the other route.

### Decision Factors:
1. Our objective is to select the route with the potential for the fewest agents in the next round to maximize our payoff relative to the fixed costs.
2. Based on recent trends, payoffs increased as agent distribution becomes more balanced.
3. The last two rounds (13 and 14) showed high payoffs for both routes when the agents were equally distributed.

### Strategic Choice:
Based on the recent trend of balanced distribution and considering our preference for maximizing payoff, the decision boils down to which pattern has a better probability of repeating. 

- The consistent high payoffs in rounds 13 and 14 may suggest an ongoing trend or equilibrium holding communication between peers about balancing route choices to ensure maximum payoff for both sides, leading me to expect a similar agent distribution might recur.

### Conclusion:
Given the balanced outcomes of rounds 13 and 14, choosing route **O-R-D** again aims to capture potential riders leaning towards O-L-D to possibly balance out choices, keeping in mind also historical rotations might suggest a swap.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision, let's analyze the data from the previous rounds:

1. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - When fewer agents choose a specific route, the payoff increases.
   - Balancing the number of agents on each route tends to yield higher payoffs for both routes, as noticed in rounds 13, 14, and 15, where 9 agents chose each route, resulting in a payoff of 100.

2. **Impact of Route Choices:**
   - Route O-L-D has a variable cost component of 10X, making it more expensive when more agents choose this route.
   - Conversely, route O-R-D has a fixed initial cost but a variable component of 10Y, impacting the cost when more agents choose it.

3. **Recent Results:**
   - The strategy of balancing seems to provide a more consistent and higher payoff.
   - Alternating between the routes while anticipating the potential decisions of other agents could yield positive results.

4. **Behavioral Insights:**
   - Agents seem to switch based on payoffs, leading to alternating load balancing.
   - As observed in the last three rounds, a nearly equal distribution provides a strong payoff.

### Decision Strategy:
Given the data, choosing route O-L-D might slightly increase my payoff if other agents aim to capitalize on the balanced trend seen in the last few rounds. The pattern is likely adjusting toward that balance, but randomness from other agents can still be a factor. However, considering the strong balance trend, choosing route O-R-D seems to be strategically favorable to maintain the high payoff observed from the balance.

Based on the above analysis, I will choose the route **O-R-D**.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To choose the optimal route for the next round, let's evaluate the past performance based on the number of agents on each route and the consequent payoffs:

1. **Assess past rounds:**
   - When many drivers choose one route, its cost increases due to higher congestion, making the other route potentially more cost-effective.
   - In rounds 13, 14, and 15, the agents were evenly split, providing a balanced scenario for both routes with a payoff of 100.
   - Rounds where I received a high payoff (80+) generally involved a more even distribution of agents or fewer agents on my chosen path.

2. **Trends and patterns:**
   - Recently, there have been fluctuations with some rounds having balanced distributions (e.g., Round 13, 14, 15), while others have a more pronounced preference by other drivers (e.g., Rounds 9 and 16).
   - My highest payoff in recent rounds was in an evenly split situation or when I chose less crowded routes.

3. **Strategic decision:**
   - Aim for balance or choose the less popular route if previous patterns suggest heavy traffic on one route.
   - Considering the even split in recent rounds (13, 14, 15), driving strategy might indicate potential equilibrium. However, Round 16 indicates a shift toward O-R-D popularity.

4. **Projection:**
   - Assuming drivers may balance out more if aware, but might also continue trends like in Round 16, where O-R-D had increased traffic.

5. **Decision:**
   - Opt for O-L-D if you anticipate others might choose O-R-D (based on congestion in Round 16).
   - Alternatively, if expecting an equilibrium, decide based on intuition or external hints.

Given these considerations, and aiming to capitalize on potential misjudgments of others, I'll choose:

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision on which route to choose for the next round, let's analyze the previous rounds and the payoffs associated with each route choice:

### Observations:
1. **Balanced Payoffs**:
   - When the agents are balanced across routes, the payoff tends to be higher. For instance, in rounds with payoffs of 100 points, there were equal numbers of agents on each route (9 on each).

2. **Route O-R-D Preferences**:
   - Optimal scenarios with high payoff (e.g., 80+ points) for this route occurred when the number of agents was relatively lower than usual. Examples are when it was less than 11, such as in Round 10, with 10 agents on O-R-D.
   - Crowded scenarios with more than 12 agents on this route lead to lower payoffs.

3. **Route O-L-D Preferences**:
   - Highest payoffs (e.g., 120) occur when fewer agents chose this route (7 agents in Round 11).
   - Again, crowding beyond 10 agents generally leads to middling or lower payoffs.

### Current Situation:
- The recent choice distribution shows some variability but a tendency towards more balanced choices; for instance, Rounds 13 to 15 featured even distribution and higher payoffs.

Given the existing pattern, if other drivers have been alternating strategies as well, it's reasonable to assume that a few might return to balancing strategies. Choosing a route that might be anticipated as less crowded could lead to higher payoffs.

### Decision:
- Based on prior rounds and maximizing payoff strategy, **deviating towards Route O-L-D** when the assumption favors shift might provide the edge needed since the payoff trend shows optimal gain with slightly fewer agents than Route O-R-D.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision, let's analyze the past rounds to identify any patterns or strategies that could maximize your payoff. We'll consider the following factors:

1. Payoff Patterns:
   - The highest payoff received was 120 in Round 11 on route O-L-D with 7 agents on O-L-D and 11 on O-R-D.
   - Payoffs of 100 were consistently achieved on the O-R-D route when there were 9 agents each on both routes (Rounds 13, 14, and 15).
   - Rounds with balanced numbers on both routes (e.g., 9-9 split) seem to yield decent payoffs on route O-R-D.

2. Opponent Behavior:
   - There has been variability in the number of agents choosing each route, with occasional large swings (e.g., Round 2 had all agents on O-L-D).
   - More recently, there seems to be a rough balance or slight preference towards O-R-D (e.g., recent rounds often show agents close to even split or more leaning towards O-R-D).

3. Strategies and Considerations:
   - To minimize travel costs, align with the majority when possible or choose the route that recently had fewer participants if seeking a lower cost on the flexible-cost segments.
   - With recent balanced splits between routes, choosing the stable route O-R-D might yield favorable results given its consistent performance in balanced situations.

Considering these observations, going for route O-R-D is a reasonable choice given the current trend towards balance and historically decent payoffs in balanced scenarios.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision for the next round, let's analyze the information we have from the previous rounds.

1. **Cost Calculation**: 
   - The cost for choosing route O-L-D is \(10 \times X + 210\), where X is the number of agents choosing O-L-D.
   - The cost for choosing route O-R-D is \(210 + 10 \times Y\), where Y is the number of agents choosing O-R-D.

2. **Round Observations**:
   - Payoffs were highest in situations where the number of agents on each route was balanced (e.g., both routes had 9 agents).
   - Route O-R-D tends to provide higher payoffs when fewer agents choose it, similar with O-L-D.
   
3. **Pattern**:
   - It's observed that an even distribution (8-10 to 10-8 agents) tends to yield higher payoffs.
   - When either route has significantly less traffic (<9), it often provides higher payoffs.

4. **Recent Trends**:
   - The recent rounds (Rounds 17-19) show a fluctuating pattern, but decent payoffs can be achieved from both routes.
   - However, the overall theme is to aim for a route that might have near-balanced usage to avoid over-congestion.

5. **Decision**:
   - Since previous rounds showed that even distributions tend to yield better payoffs and given recent patterns, I will aim to choose the route that seems slightly less popular or aim for a balance.

Based on this analysis, I will choose route 'O-R-D' for the next round, expecting a balanced usage pattern and hoping to achieve a similar distribution of agents across both routes.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision about which route to choose in the next round, we need to analyze the summary of previous rounds. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the observations:

1. **Patterns in Route Choices:**
   - In rounds where the number of agents on O-R-D was higher, your payoff tended to be lower when you chose the O-R-D route. This is expected since the cost increases with the number of drivers on that segment.
   - Conversely, when the number of agents choosing O-L-D was lower, your payoff was higher when you chose the O-L-D route.

2. **Balanced Scenarios:**
   - Payoffs were notably higher when the distribution of agents was relatively balanced between O-L-D and O-R-D, particularly around 8-9 agents on each route. This resulted in payoffs around 100 points.

3. **Route Comparison:**
   - The cost for O-L-D is 10X + 210 where X is the number of drivers on that route.
   - The cost for O-R-D is 210 + 10Y where Y is the number of drivers on that route.
   
   Since your goal is to minimize costs (and thus maximize payoffs), selecting a route with fewer competing agents typically results in a lower travel cost and a higher payoff.

4. **Recent Trends and Decisions:**
   - In recent rounds (particularly Rounds 13-20), decisions leading to balanced or near-balanced traffic on both routes have been more successful. Payoffs of 100 were received with 9 agents on each route.

Based on this step-by-step analysis, to maximize your potential payoff, it would be strategic to choose the route that appears to be less favored in the current context, aiming for a balance or slightly tipping towards a side with fewer agents, especially targeting an even split of agents across both routes.

Given how there tends to be more agents historically on the O-R-D route, and in the last round, the split was 5 on O-L-D and 13 on O-R-D, continuing to choose O-L-D might potentially yield a higher payoff in the upcoming round by targeting a more balanced distribution of agents. Let's make this decision:

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision on which route to choose for the next round, let's analyze the data from previous rounds:

1. **Identify Payoff Patterns**:
   - High payoffs are obtained when the number of people on a route is balanced or slightly fewer: 9 each on both routes yielded payoffs of 100.
   - Payoffs tend to be lower when route preferences are skewed heavily towards one route.

2. **Consequences of Overcrowding**:
   - In rounds where more than 13 drivers chose the same route, the payoff tends to drop significantly (payoffs were as low as 10 and 30).

3. **Balanced Distribution**:
   - When more balanced, such as 8-10 or 9-9 on routes, the payoffs are higher ranging from 90 to 120.

4. **Recent Trends**:
   - In recent rounds (19-21), there has been some fluctuation with fairly balanced distribution: 9-9 yielded a solid payoff, and switching from 13 drivers in one route to segments being steadier with 8 and 10 drivers provided a payoff of 90 and 110 respectively.
  
5. **Route Fluctuations**:
   - It seems participants might be adjusting back and forth to try to maintain balance, indicated by alternating between 8-10 and 9-9 distributions.

6. **Current Observation**:
   - There’s a potential trend of moving towards a slightly heavier preference for O-R-D, while O-L-D is becoming relatively less crowded.

Based on these observations, it would be strategic to choose the slightly less popular route that maintains the balance of players across both options, improving payoff consistency and avoiding overcrowding, which historically led to lower payoffs. Given the last even rounds and the system evolving towards balance:

- **Choose Route O-L-D**: Recent trends show that when the balance is slightly on the side of O-R-D, choosing O-L-D in competitive advantage minimizes costs. This decision is based on observing the payoff trends and ensuring lesser crowding.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision on route selection, let's analyze the data from previous rounds to identify patterns and make a balanced decision that maximizes potential payoff.

### Analysis of Previous Rounds:
1. **Consistent 9-9 Split:** There have been rounds (13, 14, 15, 19) where both routes were perfectly balanced with 9 agents each, resulting in a payoff of 100 for `O-R-D`.
2. **High Payoff Observations:**
   - **Route O-L-D with fewer agents:** High payoffs of 120 and 110 were seen when the number of agents on `O-L-D` was 7 and 8 respectively.
   - **Route O-R-D with balanced split:** Payoffs of around 100 were observed during balanced routes (9 agents on each).
3. **Lower Payoffs:**
   - Route `O-L-D` with maximum agents (such as 15 or 18) led to very low payoffs.
   - Route `O-R-D` when significantly crowded (like 12 or 13 agents) also led to reduced payoffs, although not as extreme as `O-L-D`.

### Decision Strategy:
- **Target Balanced Rounds:** Aim for a balanced split to gain a predictable and decent payoff. Recent patterns suggest balanced splits can be beneficial, especially for `O-R-D`.
- **Adaptive Strategy:** The payoffs in recent rounds (21 and 22) show that `O-L-D` can later provide a notable payoff when it’s chosen by more participants, positioning a counterbalance opportunity for selecting `O-R-D` now.
- **Choose Route O-R-D:** Based on the observation that `O-R-D` provides optimal payoffs in balanced rounds, and considering the potential for reverting patterns in participant choices.

Given these observations, the best course of action is to select route `'O-R-D'`.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an optimal decision based on the previous rounds' data, let's start by analyzing the patterns and payoffs:

1. **Constant Payoff Analysis**:
   - Route 'O-L-D' payoffs ranged from 10 to 120.
   - Route 'O-R-D' payoffs ranged from 30 to 100.
   - Higher payoffs were generally seen when the agent count was balanced between the two routes or slightly favored the route chosen.

2. **Balancing the Agents**:
   - Payoffs were maximized when there were approximately equal numbers of agents on each route. Typical payoffs of 100 were seen when there were 9 agents on each route.
   - Choosing a path with significantly fewer agents led to higher costs and lower payoffs.
   
3. **Recent Patterns**:
   - Lately, the rounds have had a more even distribution of agents between the routes. Payoffs around 100 were consistent with approximately equal agents on each route (Round 13, 14, 15, 19).

4. **Strategic Decision**:
   - Given the recent patterns and availability of agents on both routes, choosing a route that has potential for fewer agents would maximize payoff.
   - A possible choice is to switch to the less popular route when a trend is noticed. For example, in Rounds 10 or 19, switching when others might heavily favor one route might yield a higher payoff.

5. **Current Trend**:
   - Route preference seems cyclic, with agents shifting between rounds. Observing the recent trend, as seen in Rounds 22 and 23, more agents chose 'O-R-D' recently.

Considering these points, I would strategically choose the route with a good chance of balanced agent presence or slightly following the trend but anticipating a change. There’s a fair amount of intelligence indicating that switching routes might lead to a more balanced distribution:

### Decision

Given the slight recent preference for 'O-R-D' and patterns indicating better payoffs with balanced choices, switching to 'O-L-D' could potentially offer a better payoff due to anticipated balancing:

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide which route to choose for the next round, let's analyze the pattern in the previous rounds and attempt to identify the strategy that maximizes the payoff.

### Analysis of Past Rounds:

1. **Payoffs and Traffic Conditions:**
   - The highest payoffs are generally achieved when there is a more balanced distribution of drivers between routes O-L-D and O-R-D.
   - You received payoffs of 100 points when there were 9 drivers on both routes (Rounds 13, 14, and 15).
   - Payoffs drop significantly when there is an imbalance with the majority on one route.

2. **Learning from Patterns:**
   - When more drivers chose O-L-D, your payoffs were lower if you also chose O-L-D (e.g., Round 24 with a payoff of 50).
   - Conversely, when more drivers chose O-R-D and you chose O-L-D, you received better payoffs (e.g., Round 6 with a payoff of 60).

3. **Recent Rounds:**
   - In the most recent observed rounds, there were several times where you achieved good payoffs on both routes when the split was fairly even or slightly imbalanced.
   - The choices that led to 90 or 100 point payoffs had a near-even split, suggesting that predicting equal distribution was beneficial.

### Decision Rationale:
Given the analysis, it appears advantageous to choose a route that maintains or achieves a balanced or near-balanced distribution of drivers on the alternate route to optimize payoff. Given that there was a large number of drivers historically fluctuating between the two routes, choosing the less popular route in the prior round can be optimal if others attempt to balance the traffic.

In **Round 24**, a significant imbalance (14 on O-L-D vs. 4 on O-R-D) suggests potential adjustment by participants in the upcoming round. Opting for the previously under-selected route may yield a better distribution and increased payoff. Therefore, choosing **O-R-D** might maximize payoff as drivers adjust in the following round.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision on which route to choose, we need to consider the outcomes from previous rounds and try to anticipate the choices of other participants. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Understand the Cost Structure:**
   - O-L-D costs: \(210 + 10X\) where \(X\) is the number of participants choosing O-L-D.
   - O-R-D costs: \(210 + 10Y\) where \(Y\) is the number of participants choosing O-R-D.

2. **Analyze Past Behavior:**
   - There have been varying numbers of participants choosing each route across different rounds.
   - Rounds with a more balanced distribution of participants (e.g., 9 on each route) tend to yield higher payoffs (like 100 points).

3. **Recent Trends:**
   - The last five rounds show a tendency for participants to increasingly balance between routes or slightly favor one. Especially in rounds 19-25, there was an alternation between balanced and imbalanced choice, giving high payoffs when choices were more balanced.

4. **Payoffs:**
   - The highest payoffs were observed when both routes had a similar number of participants.
   - Choosing a route with fewer participants generally resulted in higher individual payoffs.

5. **Decision Strategy:**
   - We aim to anticipate the choice of others while slightly favoring the less chosen route to maximize payoff.
   - Given the alternating nature of the past few rounds, there might be a slight imbalance in favor of O-R-D soon, as it alternated from being the less chosen to the more chosen route.

6. **Conclusion and Choice:**
   - Considering the tendency for participants to balance after rounds of imbalance and the payoff history, choosing the O-R-D route might offer a similar or higher payoff if participants lean towards balancing again in the upcoming round. Additionally, if others perceive recent bias towards O-L-D, they might prefer O-R-D next, making it a strategic choice.

Thus, I will choose the route: O-R-D.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision about which route to choose in the next round, let's analyze the results from the previous rounds:

1. **Determine Cost Structures:**
   - The cost for the route O-L-D is dynamic based on the number of agents X using the formula: \(10X + 210\).
   - Similarly, the cost for the route O-R-D is: \(210 + 10Y\).

2. **Analyze Historical Data:**
   - When there is a more balanced split between the two routes, payoffs seem generally higher. This would indicate a situation where congestion is minimized on both routes.
   - Historically, payoffs over 80 tend to occur when there are around 9 agents on each route, leading to equal distribution of traffic. 
   - In cases when one of the routes has significantly more traffic (>13 agents), the payoff tends to reduce significantly.

3. **Identify Trends:**
   - Routes seem to alternate in usage, with both routes seeing moderate to heavy usage in different rounds.
   - High payoffs close to 100 (maximum possible payoff) occur when both routes are equally chosen by about 9 agents.

4. **Strategy Moving Forward:**
   - Based on the trend of recent rounds, it appears that both routes fluctuated regarding agent distribution.
   - Given the alternations between choosing routes, if a round with a payoff received of 90 or above recently occurred, choosing the less congested route in the previous round could be beneficial.

5. **Recent Rounds Analysis:**
   - In rounds where there are 8-10 agents on each route, payoffs have been relatively higher.

6. **Decision:**
   Given this analysis, and considering the recent trends of distribution where agents appear balanced, a reasonable strategy would be to choose a route that has generally seen moderate traffic (8-10 agents) in the last few rounds. This would be the opposite route to what had fewer agents based on Round 26 results.

### Decision:
Since Round 26 had 8 agents on O-L-D, leading to a payoff of 90 when you chose O-R-D, a prudent choice in the following succession for potentially better payoff alignment could be **route O-L-D**.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an optimal decision for the next round, I need to analyze the trends and payoff results from previous rounds.

1. **Observation of Payoff Patterns:**
   - The payoff is calculated as 400 - travel cost.
   - High payoff periods (100 or more) occurred when both routes were nearly balanced with approximately 9 agents each (Rounds 13, 14, 15).
   - Payoffs tend to drop significantly when there's a severe imbalance, with either route having 5 or fewer agents, indicating high congestion on the other route.

2. **Route Choice Analysis:**
   - Choosing route O-L-D when an excessive number of agents are on it resulted in much lower payoffs (e.g., Round 24 with 14 agents, payoff of 50).
   - Conversely, choosing route O-R-D when it's crowded also resulted in low payoffs (e.g., Round 16 with 12 agents, payoff of 70).

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alternate route choice based on the current trend to achieve near balance, as this has resulted in optimal payoffs in past rounds when agent count on both routes was closer to 9 (e.g., Rounds 13-15).
   - Adjust based on observed congestion. When one route repeatedly has low agents, consider switching to potentially achieve higher payoff.

4. **Recent Rounds and Trend Analysis:**
   - Observation from the last few rounds:
     - Rounds 25 to 27 show a back-and-forth pattern with an increase in agents on the previously less chosen route.
     - In Round 27, O-L-D had 10 agents, resulting in a decent payoff.
     - Considering Round 26 had 8 on O-R-D yielding a payoff of 90, congestion trends suggest stability.

**Decision for Next Round:**
Given the past few rounds, choosing route O-R-D might lead to better results. Observations suggest that the number of participants tends to fluctuate and could stabilize in the next round. 

Therefore, the decision is to go with the O-R-D route.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision on which route to choose in the next round, let's analyze the past outcomes and patterns:

1. **Patterns in Payoffs and Agent Distribution:**
    - The payoff is generally higher when the number of agents is balanced or skewed favorably towards fewer people on your chosen route.
    - The highest payoff scenarios (e.g., payoff of 100) occur when there's an even distribution of agents (9 on O-L-D and 9 on O-R-D).
    - The lowest payoffs are associated with more extreme imbalances.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
    - The cost of route O-L-D is \(10X + 210\).
    - The cost of route O-R-D is \(210 + 10Y\).
    - Your payoff is \(400\) minus the travel cost. Maximizng payoff involves choosing the path with minimal cost given the distribution.

3. **Recent Trends:**
    - In recent rounds (26, 27, 28), choosing route O-R-D gives a decent payoff (90) when there's a slighly heavier load on O-L-D.
    - Similarly, choosing O-L-D yielded good payoffs when the load was heavier on O-R-D.

4. **Strategy Decision:**
    - Recent split shows high payoffs when there's a more balanced agent distribution or when selecting the route that appears less crowded.
    - In the immediate past rounds, after rounds where O-L-D had more agents, some drivers seem to shift to O-R-D and vice versa, creating the possibility of achieving balance.

Given these observations, it may be beneficial to choose the route that was more populated recently since drivers might shift to the lesser-populated route from previous rounds.

For this decision step:
- Last round, O-R-D had more agents (Y = 13), which resulted in a lower payoff.
- Strategy: Choose O-L-D, anticipating some agents shifting to O-L-D from O-R-D and the chance for balanced agent distribution.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
Let's analyze the outcomes of previous rounds to determine the best strategy going forward.

1. **Observation of Patterns**:
   - The route O-R-D generally provides a higher payoff when the number of drivers is balanced, around 9 on each route. This has happened frequently in rounds 13, 14, 15, and 19.
   - Choosing O-L-D is beneficial when there are fewer agents on the O-R-D route. However, it seems that as the number of drivers on O-L-D increases past 10, the payoff dramatically decreases, as seen in rounds 2, 6, 24, and 29.

2. **Average Payoffs**:
   - A balanced usage of routes tends to yield better payoffs, allowing a participant to reach around 90-100 points, as seen in some rounds where both routes have 8-10 agents.

3. **Fluctuations and Volatility**:
   - The O-R-D route has shown more variability in the payoff when there's a disparity in the number of agents, sometimes yielding lower payoffs as seen in rounds like 1, 3, and 28.

4. **Trends in Recent Rounds**:
   - Lately, payoffs seem to stabilize in the range of 80-110 when agents are spread more evenly, around 8-10 on each route. Despite that, choosing routes with higher agents sometimes results in lower payoffs.

5. **Strategic Decision**:
   - As the past rounds have shown, predictable high payoffs can be achieved by aiming for balance or slightly tilting towards the less populated route. Given that recent rounds have seen varying levels, and O-L-D often jumps in population unpredictably leading to reduced payoff, the more stable choice tends to stay balanced or switch based on crowding tendency previously noticed.

Therefore, for the next round, I will choose the route that appears to have fewer agents, continuing from the most recent stable payoff patterns. Given the data, I will proceed with:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide which route to take in the upcoming round, let's analyze the data from the previous rounds and assess which route might provide a better payoff based on patterns observed.

### Step 1: Reviewing Payoffs

1. **Identifying Payoffs by Routes:**
   - **O-L-D:** The payoffs when choosing O-L-D have varied but have been quite decent in some rounds, especially in rounds where less than or around 10 agents chose it.
   - **O-R-D:** Similarly, O-R-D has also had good payoffs, especially when fewer drivers chose it.

2. **Recent Trends:**
   - There are notable instances where choosing a route with fewer agents resulted in higher payoffs, such as rounds with balanced choices or lean towards one direction (O-L-D or O-R-D).

### Step 2: Patterns and Insight

1. When **O-R-D** was chosen and the count was around 7 to 10 drivers, the payoff was typically higher.
2. When **O-L-D** was chosen with a similar count (around 8 to 11 drivers), the payoff was also favorable.

### Step 3: Predictive Strategy

- In general, balancing the number of participants per route tends to yield higher payoffs.
- Consider alternating strategies based on recent rounds to avoid congestion:
  - The last round choice (Round 30) resulted in high number of drivers choosing O-R-D. This pattern might suggest that players will tend to switch to the less congested O-L-D route in the upcoming round for a better outcome.

### Step 4: Decision

- Based on the analysis, and the expectation that others may shift, choosing **O-L-D** could maximize the chance of a better payoff if others similarly aim to switch to the less crowded route from the previous round.

Therefore, the decision for the upcoming round would be:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision, let's analyze the given data and think through a few steps:

1. **Understand Cost Structure**:  
   - For route O-L-D: The cost is `10X + 210`. Since X represents the number of drivers on route O-L-D, the cost increases by 10 for each additional driver on this route.
   - For route O-R-D: The cost is `210 + 10Y`. Y represents the number of drivers on route O-R-D; hence the cost increases by 10 for each additional driver on this route.

2. **Objective**: Our goal is to select the route with the lower travel cost, maximizing our payoff. The payoff is 400 minus the travel cost.

3. **Examine Past Rounds**:  
   - The payoff varies significantly based on the number of drivers choosing each route.
   - Balanced route selections, such as some rounds where 9 participants choose each route, result in higher payoffs (e.g., 100).
   - Extreme imbalances typically lead to better payoffs on the less congested route.

4. **Trends**:
   - When many drivers choose one route (e.g., 16 on O-R-D), switching to the less crowded O-L-D provided better payoffs.
   - Decisions alternated between routes based on the past choice's congestion, aiming for less crowded paths in subsequent rounds.

5. **Predictive Choice for Next Round**:
   - Recent patterns suggest a somewhat predictable oscillation where once a route gets crowded, drivers tend to switch to the other route.
   - In the latest round (Round 31), O-L-D had 12 drivers; suggesting predictably more participants might choose O-R-D in the next round to balance the congestion.
   - Hence, with the last round's higher congestion on O-L-D, opting for O-R-D seems to be the strategic choice.

Based on this analysis, the strategic choice is:

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
Based on the summary of previous rounds, let's analyze the situation:

1. **Balance of Routes:**
   - The number of agents on each route tends to oscillate. There doesn't seem to be a stable equilibrium, indicating that other participants are also actively changing their decisions based on past rounds.
   
2. **Payoff Analysis:**
   - The highest payoffs are achieved when the decision evenly splits the participant traffic (9 agents on each route), resulting in a payoff of 100.
   - Payoffs tend to decrease as more agents crowd onto the selected route.
   - A reasonable number of agents on the same route is 7-9 to maintain moderate costs and high payoffs. 

3. **Recent Trends:**
   - In the most recent round (Round 32), route O-R-D was crowded with 13 agents while O-L-D had only 5, leading to a low payoff for those who chose O-R-D.
   - There is a pattern where whenever one route becomes too crowded, the following round seeks rebalancing (e.g., after Round 30 where O-R-D was too crowded, the next round saw O-L-D as the more crowded route).

4. **Decision Insight:**
   - Given that in Round 32, the route O-R-D had 13 agents, it's likely that several participants might switch to O-L-D in the upcoming round to improve their payoff—given historical shifts following a heavily crowded round.
   - Therefore, route O-L-D may become slightly more crowded.

5. **Strategic Decision:**
   - Choosing the less crowded route from the recent trend is one approach—but anticipating the behavior of the other agents is crucial. Given the trend and my analysis, agents who had recently been on the crowded O-R-D might switch.
   
Therefore, it might be more advantageous to choose route **O-R-D** for this upcoming round, predicting a shift in participants trying to balance from the previous overcrowded selection. This decision attempts to capitalize on less crowded conditions and improved payoffs as other agents adjust their strategy away from O-R-D.

With all this in mind, the decision is:

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
From the summary of previous rounds, let's analyze your payoffs based on the route chosen:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Payoffs varied from 10 to 120.
   - Payoffs generally tend to be higher when fewer agents choose this route.
   - Lower payoffs are typically associated with higher numbers of agents choosing this route.

2. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Payoffs varied from 30 to 140.
   - Payoffs are generally higher when fewer agents choose this route.
   - The highest payoff of 140 occurred when only 5 agents chose this route.

**Observation Pattern:**
- When the number of agents on a given route decreases, the payoff increases for that route.
- Balanced distributions (close to equal or slightly uneven numbers) offer relatively predictable and decent payoffs.
- Extremes (many on one route, few on the other) can lead to extreme payoffs: very high for the less chosen route, and very low for the more chosen route.

**Decision Strategy:**
- Balancing between not overloading a route while maximizing your payoff is key.
- Look for patterns where fewer agents have recently chosen a route, as it may be a potentially less crowded route in the next round.
- Consider the recent trends in agent distribution across the routes.

Based on the most recent information:
- In round 33, when you chose route O-R-D, fewer agents were on this route compared to O-L-D, resulting in the highest payoff observed overall (140).
- Before that, often when you chose O-R-D, it led to a decent payoff except for when there were extreme imbalances (e.g., when 13-16 agents chose it).
- Conversely, O-L-D provided good payoffs when it was not overloaded (8-10 agents seem a sweet spot).

In light of the above analysis, let's decide for the next round:

Given the recent high payoff on route O-R-D when fewer agents chose it, and considering the variable nature of the agent's choice trend, it may have a slightly lower competition in the upcoming round.

Thus, it would be strategic to choose:

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision about which route to choose for the next round, let's analyze the previous rounds and consider an optimal strategy.

### Analysis of Previous Rounds
1. **Cost Structure**: 
   - Route O-L-D cost = 10X + 210 where X is the number of agents choosing this route.
   - Route O-R-D cost = 210 + 10Y where Y is the number of agents choosing this route.

2. **Patterns in Payoffs**:
   - A high number of agents on a route typically leads to a lower payoff.
   - Both routes offer similar payoffs when they are balanced (9 vs 9 agents) due to fixed costs being equal.

3. **Observation of Trends**:
   - Payoffs have been higher for balanced routes with equal or similar distribution.
   - Extreme imbalance like very few agents on one route (O-L-D: 2) results in a higher cost and lower payoff for the majority route (O-R-D: 16).

4. **Past Payoff Insight**:
   - High payoffs (100 or more) occur when the routes are somewhat evenly distributed.
   - Extremely imbalanced scenarios usually benefit the minority route and penalize the majority.

### Strategy for Route Selection
Given the above insights and trends, the aim is to anticipate the choice of other drivers and potentially balance the distribution for a better payoff. Here are a few speculative thoughts:

- If there's an inclination towards many agents picking one route, you could benefit by choosing the less popular route.
- Often routes seem to converge around 9 vs 9 for a decent payoff.
  
### Next Move
Given the latest round where Routes were imbalanced (3 agents on O-L-D and 15 on O-R-D), many agents might opt for O-L-D next turn to avoid congestion, making O-R-D potentially less populated.

Therefore, for the next round, to potentially gain a high payoff, choosing the less crowded route based on current trends (likely to be 'O-R-D') might be a strategic decision.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To determine which route to choose in Round 36, we need to consider several factors based on the data from previous rounds. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Examine Payoffs and Agent Distribution**:
    - Historically, the even distribution (9 agents per route) maximized payoff to 100 points, while more skewed distributions (e.g., 13-5) resulted in either very high or very low payoffs depending on your choice.
    - The highest payoffs (140 points) occurred when choosing O-R-D while the majority (13) chose O-L-D.
    - Conversely, 16 choosing O-R-D led you, when on O-R-D, to lower payoffs (30 points).
    - Higher payoffs on O-L-D often occur when fewer agents choose this route.

2. **Recent Trends and Repetitions**:
    - Notably, the pattern of agents choosing O-R-D stabilizing as 13 has happened multiple times (Rounds 9, 5, 1, 32).
    - In such configurations, choosing O-L-D led to higher payoffs compared to others.

3. **Risk and Reward**:
    - Route O-R-D provides high rewards if fewer people choose it, leading to less congestion and lower costs.
    - O-L-D, when chosen by fewer participants, led to relatively stable payoffs above 100 in several rounds.

4. **Alternating Choices**:
    - Alternation after high O-R-D participation often returns successful results when switching to O-L-D. 

5. **Strategic Choice for Round 36**:
    - Based on trends, it might be wise to choose O-L-D assuming the pattern of heavy O-R-D use continues. Recent rounds included several where O-R-D was the more popular route.

Given these points, choosing route O-L-D seems to balance the risk of low payoff with potential for a higher payoff should the majority move to O-R-D.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide which route to choose, let's analyze the pattern from the previous rounds:

1. **Balancing the Routes**: 
    - The payoff tends to be higher when the number of agents on each route is closer to being evenly balanced.
    - Rounds with 9 agents on each route provided a consistent payoff of 100, indicating a balanced state.

2. **Extreme Imbalances**:
    - When either route has significantly more agents than the other, the payoff dropped significantly.
    - For instance, when O-L-D had 18 agents and O-R-D had 0, the payoff was only 10.
    - Conversely, when O-R-D had 16 agents, the payoff was also low at 30.

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
    - The highest payoff (140) occurred when O-L-D had 13 agents and O-R-D had 5 agents.
    - This suggests that if many agents start to move towards one route, the other becomes optimal quickly.

4. **Recent Trends**:
    - Recently, round 36 balanced out again with 9 agents on each route. 
    - The previous two rounds before that (33 and 35) had an unbalanced split favoring O-L-D.

**Decision Strategy**:
Given this history, choosing the route with fewer agents seems optimal, as this balances out the routes. Also, anticipate that if a pattern repeats, especially high imbalance, the opposite route might provide better payoffs.

**Conclusion for Next Round**:
Since Round 36 was balanced and there's a shifted trend towards more people potentially choosing O-R-D (as in rounds 33-35), it would be strategic to choose the route that is opposite to the prediction if everyone thinks others might choose the currently popular route. Let's predict and pick:

- **Prediction**: People might trend back to O-R-D (balancing from last round).
- **Choice**: O-L-D, assuming the trend oscillation could cause others to favor O-R-D for this round.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
Let’s analyze the previous data to inform the decision on which route to take:

1. **Route Cost Calculation**:
   - **Route O-L-D Cost**: \( 10X + 210 \)
   - **Route O-R-D Cost**: \( 210 + 10Y \)

2. **Performance Review**:
   - **O-L-D Performance**: Higher payoffs tend to occur when fewer agents choose this route. The highest payoffs (90, 110, 140) were achieved when the number of agents was between 8 to 13, and you were among them.
   - **O-R-D Performance**: Payoffs often fluctuate widely due to congestion. It's similar; higher payoffs have been seen when 9 agents or less choose this route.

3. **Trend Analysis**:
   - The participants often switch between routes, adjusting based on previous congestion levels. When one route gets overcrowded, some participants tend to switch to the other in subsequent rounds.

4. **Recent Observations (Rounds 33-37)**:
   - You earned payoffs of 140, 40, 140, 100, and 110.
   - Higher payoffs (e.g., 140) on Route O-R-D were when fewer people opted for it.

5. **Next Round Decision**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: Recent rounds (36 and 37) show a balanced choice here provides 100-110 payoffs with about 8-9 participants choosing it.
   - **Route O-R-D**: Given two recent high payoffs (140) when only 5 agents were on this route, it’s lucrative but riskier if many shift to it.

### Strategy:
- **Estimation**: It’s likely participants will shift again to optimize their payoffs.
- **Prediction**: Many might switch to Route O-L-D due to recent high payoffs on O-R-D with fewer agents.
- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - Route O-L-D can become congested.
  - Opting for Route O-R-D might lead to higher payoff if not overly congested.

Based on the pattern and the objective to avoid congestion and maximize payoff, I will choose:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

This choice relies on the assumption that other participants will shift to Route O-L-D to follow the recent payoff trend, potentially leaving Route O-R-D less crowded.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision, we need to analyze the pattern of previous rounds focusing on the payoff and the number of agents on each route. 

We know:
1. Payoff decreases as more agents select the same route because the cost on variable segments (O-L and R-D) increases.
2. A balanced load between the two routes or slightly underbalanced load tends to yield higher payoffs.

Let's summarize notable patterns:
- Rounds with approximately an equal or near-equal distribution of agents on both routes often resulted in higher payoffs. For instance:
  - Round 13, 14, 15, and 36: Both O-L-D and O-R-D had 9 agents each, and payoffs were 100, 100, 100, and 100 respectively.
- Extremely uneven distributions (few agents on one route and many on the other) also provided a high payoff but were less predictable:
  - Round 33 and 35: 5 agents on O-R-D vs 13 on O-L-D led to a high payoff of 140 for those choosing O-R-D.
  - Round 18 and 22, 8 agents on O-L-D vs 10 on O-R-D gave a payoff of 110 for those on O-L-D.

Recent trends show:
- Round 38 had fewer agents (7) on O-R-D than O-L-D (11) leading to a high payoff of 120 for choosing O-R-D indicating a slight advantage.
- Recent rounds feature a shift such that when slightly more agents choose one route, the other starts yielding higher payoffs due to the cost dynamics.

A choice strategy could be to anticipate the number of agents and opt for the less chosen route or balance it evenly to maximize payoffs under uncertainty:

### Decision:
Given the recent trend from round 38, where a smaller number of agents was on O-R-D and this resulted in a payoff of 120, a rational expectation could suggest that agents might shift towards O-L-D as they try to capitalize on past high payoffs.

Therefore, choosing **route O-L-D** might be beneficial if we anticipate others overcorrecting towards the opposite route.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an optimal decision for the next round, let's review the past patterns and strategies:

1. **Payoff Patterns:**
   - The highest payoffs are achieved when the number of participants on the chosen route is balanced or fewer.
   - For O-R-D, high payoffs occurred when fewer participants also chose that route, such as in Rounds 13, 14, 15, and 33.
   - For O-L-D, high payoffs were seen when the number of participants was balanced or when fewer people were on O-L-D compared to O-R-D.

2. **Route Fluctuations:**
   - Many drivers switch routes when certain routes are overloaded, resulting in lower payoffs.
   - There is a tendency for participants to react to imbalances, which means choosing the less popular route in the next round often yields better results.

3. **Route Popularity:**
   - O-R-D tends to become overcrowded with participants, as evidenced by several rounds where choosing it resulted in lower payoffs (e.g., 60 points in multiple rounds).
   - O-L-D has provided moderate to good payoffs when not overloaded (e.g., in recent rounds like 37).

4. **Most Recent Rounds:**
   - In the recent round (39), you received a payoff of 60 by choosing O-L-D, which mirrored earlier rounds where choosing the crowded route resulted in lower payoffs.

5. **Strategy for Next Round:**
   - This analysis suggests that strategic choice would involve anticipating shifts based on past overcrowding trends.
   - Given that the most recent round saw O-L-D being more popular, and considering the observed payoff from round 38 with O-R-D, it might be beneficial to anticipate that some players will shift back to O-R-D in Round 40. Based on this reasoning:

Given these considerations, choosing route **O-R-D** might maximize the chances of higher payoffs in the upcoming round.
