System Message:

You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Round 1:
Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision on which route to choose, let's analyze the costs associated with each option, considering that the objective is to minimize cost, hence maximizing payoff. 

1. **Understand the Routes and Costs:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** The cost is calculated as \( 10X + 210 \), where \( X \) is the total number of participants choosing this route.
   - **Route O-R-D:** The cost is calculated as \( 210 + 10Y \), where \( Y \) is the total number of participants choosing this route.

2. **Initial Analysis:**
   - The cost for segment O-L and R-D is variable depending on how many drivers choose them because it multiplies by 10.
   - The cost for segments O-R and L-D is fixed at 210.

3. **Choosing Strategy:**
   - If many participants choose the same route, the cost of that route will increase substantially due to the variable cost component.
   - If fewer participants choose a particular route, it would likely result in a lower cost due to the lower number of people affecting the variable cost.

4. **Decision-Making Strategy:**
   - Assume that the decision for each participant is independent, and without explicit information about others' choices, we must rely on probability and systematic reasoning.
   - Given symmetry and the potential fact that participants may act randomly or opt to split based on past feedback, attempt to initially balance between the routes.

5. **Considering Costs in the Long Term:**
   - In subsequent rounds, you'll gain more information about which routes are popular based on the results shared.
   - If a route (e.g., O-L-D) is often crowded based on observed trends, it might be better to switch to O-R-D to potentially encounter lower costs.

6. **Implementation of the Choice:**
   - For the initial choice, without data on participant tendencies, an evenly split scenario is logical, minimizing costs: opt for Route O-R-D since it might be less attractive at first glance (due to its seemingly higher fixed cost in raw numerics) which might imply fewer choosing it.

Thus, to optimize initially, choose the less popular route for the first round, knowing it can be adjusted in later rounds with feedback insight:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 2:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 60.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 5 agents
        O-R-D: 13 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision, let's analyze the previous round and consider the potential outcomes for the next round.

1. **Understanding the Costs and Payoffs:**
   - In round 1, I chose route O-R-D.
   - My payoff was 60 points, which means my travel cost was 400 (endowment) - 60 (payoff) = 340 points.
   - Given that 13 agents chose the O-R-D route, the cost on segment R-D was 10 * 13 = 130. Adding the fixed 210 for O-R, the total cost was 340, which aligns with the calculated cost.

2. **Understanding the Opposite Route:**
   - For the route O-L-D, 5 agents chose it.
   - The cost on segment O-L would have been 10 * 5 = 50, plus the fixed 210 for L-D, totaling 260.

3. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Choosing O-R-D in the previous round was more costly (340) compared to O-L-D (260).
   - This suggests that O-L-D had fewer drivers and thus was cheaper.

4. **Strategic Consideration for Next Round:**
   - If many drivers consider switching to O-L-D in the next round due to its lower cost in the previous round, the cost on O-L could increase.
   - However, the present spread (5 on O-L-D vs. 13 on O-R-D) suggests more might remain on O-R-D, especially if they don't overreact.

5. **Decision:**
   - Given the previous costs, I should aim to balance potential changes.
   - Historically lower spots tend to attract drivers, which in turn can equalize costs.
   - If I assume a moderate shift towards O-L-D, it might still be a safe choice, or if others stay consistent, O-L-D remains advantageous.

Based on this analysis, for the next round, I will choose the route that initially showed a better payoff, anticipating moderate shifts but still a comparative advantage.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 3:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 60.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 5 agents
        O-R-D: 13 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 18 agents
        O-R-D: 0 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision, let's analyze the situation based on the information provided from the previous rounds:

### Cost Calculation for Each Route

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 210, where X is the number of agents choosing O-L-D.
   
2. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost = 210 + 10Y, where Y is the number of agents choosing O-R-D.

### Previous Round Analysis

- **Round 1:**
  - I chose O-R-D, and the cost was calculated as follows:
    - 210 (fixed) + 10 * 13 (variable) = 210 + 130 = 340
    - Payoff = Endowment (400) - Cost (340) = 60

- **Round 2:**
  - I chose O-L-D, and the cost was calculated:
    - 10 * 18 = 180 + 210 = 390
    - Payoff = Endowment (400) - Cost (390) = 10

### Strategy for Current Round

Based on the previous rounds, let's evaluate the costs assuming agents distribute similarly:

- If many agents cluster on one route, the opposite route becomes cheaper due to fewer agents contributing to the variable cost.

#### Possible Scenarios:

- **All agents on O-L-D, none on O-R-D (As in Round 2):**
  - O-L-D cost = 390
  - O-R-D cost = 210
  - Choose O-R-D for a higher payoff if similar distribution happens.

- **Balanced distribution (As in Round 1):**
  - O-L-D cost was lower: 5 agents, Cost = 260
  - O-R-D cost was higher: 13 agents, Cost = 340
  - Choose O-L-D if balanced distribution is likely.

### Decision

I should select the route that potentially has fewer agents if I want to maximize my payoff:

- Since in Round 2 everyone went to O-L-D, and given the high cost associated with it, there might be a switch to the less congested O-R-D in the next rounds.
- I will select **O-R-D** hoping others will balance out their choice or remain on O-L-D.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 4:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 60.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 5 agents
        O-R-D: 13 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 18 agents
        O-R-D: 0 agents

Round 3:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 30.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 2 agents
        O-R-D: 16 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision for the next round, let's analyze the information from previous rounds:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Route: O-R-D
   - You received a payoff of 60.
   - Number of agents: O-L-D: 5, O-R-D: 13
   - Travel Cost: 400 (endowment) - 60 (payoff) = 340
   - Actual Cost Calculation:
     - O-R-D: Fixed cost 210 + 10 * 14 (since 13 others + you chose this route) = 210 + 140 = 350
     - Your payoff was slightly higher, suggesting participants may make mistakes or the scenario permits slight deviation in payoffs.

2. **Round 2:**
   - Route: O-L-D
   - You received a payoff of 10.
   - Number of agents: O-L-D: 18, O-R-D: 0
   - Travel Cost: 400 - 10 = 390
   - Actual Cost Calculation:
     - O-L-D: 10 * 18 (all participants chose this) + 210 = 180 + 210 = 390
   - The payoff corresponds to everyone choosing O-L-D, and it being the worst-case scenario for congestion on O-L-D.

3. **Round 3:**
   - Route: O-R-D
   - You received a payoff of 30.
   - Number of agents: O-L-D: 2, O-R-D: 16
   - Travel Cost: 400 - 30 = 370
   - Actual Cost Calculation:
     - O-R-D: 210 + 10 * 17 (since 16 others + you chose this route) = 210 + 170 = 380
   - Your cost calculation indicates a lower payoff than computed, possibly to favor test values presented.

**Analysis:**
- **Route O-R-D:** Historically chosen by more agents, which raises cost due to 10 * X component.
- **Route O-L-D:** When overcrowded, it sees a very high cost due to dependence on the number of agents (10 * X).

**Predicted Behavior:**
- Participants may consider switching routes due to previous overcrowding or poor payoff results. 
- In round 2, O-L-D was overcrowded, which likely discouraged participants from choosing it again.
- In round 3, O-R-D became overcrowded.

**Strategic Choice:**
Given the tendency of switching routes and potential over-saturation of routes due to prediction, choosing a less popular route may yield better payoff opportunities. Considering that players moved mostly to O-R-D in the last round, they might switch back to O-L-D again this round.

Choosing **O-L-D** could be beneficial if others choose to continue on O-R-D expecting similar trends from earlier rounds.

```

Round 5:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 60.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 5 agents
        O-R-D: 13 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 18 agents
        O-R-D: 0 agents

Round 3:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 30.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 2 agents
        O-R-D: 16 agents

Round 4:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 40.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 15 agents
        O-R-D: 3 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make the decision for the current round, let's review the outcomes from the previous rounds and understand the factors influencing the payoff.

### Overview of Cost Structure
- **Route O-L-D**: Cost = 10X (where X is the number of drivers) + 210
- **Route O-R-D**: Cost = 210 + 10Y (where Y is the number of drivers)

### Analysis of Previous Rounds
- **Round 1**: 
  - Chose O-R-D, with 13 drivers on the route.
  - Cost = 210 + 10*13 = 340. Payoff = 400 - 340 = 60.
  
- **Round 2**: 
  - Chose O-L-D, with 18 drivers on the route.
  - Cost = 10*18 + 210 = 390. Payoff = 400 - 390 = 10.
  
- **Round 3**: 
  - Chose O-R-D, with 16 drivers on the route.
  - Cost = 210 + 10*16 = 370. Payoff = 400 - 370 = 30.
  
- **Round 4**: 
  - Chose O-L-D, with 15 drivers on the route.
  - Cost = 10*15 + 210 = 360. Payoff = 400 - 360 = 40.

### Observations
- The payoff is higher when fewer drivers share the same route choice.
- The difference in payoffs when choosing the lesser-populated route (3 drivers on O-R-D or 5 on O-L-D) was more favorable.
- Round consistency shows that higher numbers on one route significantly affect the travel cost.

### Strategy for Next Round
Given the fluctuation in the number of drivers for each route, I should aim to choose the less populated route to maximize my payoff. From the analysis, when fewer agents choose O-R-D, the payoff tends to be better due to the lower additional cost from fewer participants. 

### Decision
Based on the patterns, if I anticipate that O-L-D might be overcrowded again like in Rounds 1 and 2, where it resulted in very low payoffs, it might be strategic to choose O-R-D. However, if I suspect a switch due to previous losses, choosing O-L-D might be beneficial.

In the absence of assured patterns beyond speculation, choosing a route that appears less likely to be overcrowded is advisable. As previous rounds showed heavy swings, it might be strategic to anticipate an oscillation.

Let's choose the less chosen route from last round:

{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 6:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 60.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 5 agents
        O-R-D: 13 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:

Round 4:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 40.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 15 agents
        O-R-D: 3 agents

Round 5:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 40.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 3 agents
        O-R-D: 15 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a strategic decision for the next round, let's analyze the patterns from previous rounds and calculate potential costs.

1. **Cost Calculations:**
   - **O-L-D**: Cost is `10X + 210`
   - **O-R-D**: Cost is `210 + 10Y`
   - Payoff is calculated as `400 - cost`

2. **Historical Choices and Payoffs:**
   - **Round 1:** Chose O-R-D, payoff = 60; implies 340 cost (13 on O-R-D means cost should be 210 + 10*13 = 340)
   - **Round 2:** Chose O-L-D, payoff = 10; implies 390 cost (18 on O-L-D means cost should be 10*18 + 210 = 390)
   - **Round 3:** Chose O-R-D, payoff = 30; implies 370 cost (16 on O-R-D means cost should be 210 + 10*16 = 370)
   - **Round 4:** Chose O-L-D, payoff = 40; implies 360 cost (15 on O-L-D means cost should be 10*15 + 210 = 360)
   - **Round 5:** Chose O-R-D, payoff = 40; implies 360 cost (15 on O-R-D means cost should be 210 + 10*15 = 360)

3. **Observing Patterns:**
   - Historically, the number of drivers on O-R-D has been higher or equal, leading to higher costs.
   - In rounds where O-L-D had fewer drivers, the payoff was higher.

4. **Strategy for Next Round:**
   - The goal is to minimize cost, and thus maximize payoff.
   - If fewer participants choose O-L-D, it usually results in a better payoff.
   - Recent rounds have shown fluctuations, making O-L-D potentially more favorable if fewer people choose it.

5. **Decision:**
   - Given these observations and the slight preference of agents towards O-R-D in recent rounds, choosing O-L-D may result in fewer concurrent drivers and a lower cost.

Taking into account these considerations, our strategic choice for the next round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 7:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 60.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 5 agents
        O-R-D: 13 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 10.

        O-R-D: 3 agents

Round 5:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 40.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 3 agents
        O-R-D: 15 agents

Round 6:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 60.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 13 agents
        O-R-D: 5 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To determine the optimal route choice for the next round, let's analyze the provided data for patterns and payoff outcomes:

1. **Observe Patterns in Payoffs:**
   - When you chose **O-R-D**:
     - Round 1 payoff: 60 (13 agents on O-R-D)
     - Round 3 payoff: 30 (16 agents on O-R-D)
     - Round 5 payoff: 40 (15 agents on O-R-D)
   
   - When you chose **O-L-D**:
     - Round 2 payoff: 10 (18 agents on O-L-D)
     - Round 4 payoff: 40 (15 agents on O-L-D)
     - Round 6 payoff: 60 (13 agents on O-L-D)

2. **Calculate Costs for Each Route:**
   - The cost on each route is calculated by:
     - **O-L-D:** Cost = \(10 \times \text{(agents on O-L-D)} + 210\)
     - **O-R-D:** Cost = \(210 + 10 \times \text{(agents on O-R-D)}\)

3. **Evaluate Recent Trends:**
   - In the latest round (Round 6), choosing **O-L-D** yielded a payoff of 60 when there were 13 agents on O-L-D and 5 agents on O-R-D.
   - There seems to be a switching pattern where the majority shifts between routes every few rounds.

4. **Strategic Decision:**
   - A higher payoff tends to occur when fewer agents choose the same route as you. In Round 6, fewer agents on O-R-D might imply others may start moving back to O-R-D in the subsequent round.
   - Therefore, if this observed pattern holds, it might be beneficial to anticipate and choose **O-R-D** this round, assuming some agents might switch routes again.

Based on this analysis, the optimal choice for the next round would be to select the route:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision for the next round, let's analyze the past rounds data to identify patterns that may help predict the behavior of other drivers.

1. **Observation of Patterns:**
   - When more drivers choose a route, the cost increases due to the term "10X" or "10Y", reducing the payoff.
   - Route O-R-D had high participation in Rounds 1, 3, and 5, resulting in relatively low payoffs (60, 30, and 40 points, respectively).
   - Route O-L-D, when chosen with fewer drivers, yielded higher payoffs. For example, in Round 6, with 13 agents, the payoff was 60 points.

2. **Strategy:**
   - Aim to select the route expected to have fewer drivers to maximize payoff.
   - However, as drivers adjust their choices round by round looking to maximize their own payoffs, the attractiveness of each route changes constantly. 
   - Historically, alternating between routes seems to balance the load, as seen in past rounds. The participants switch when they notice a route becoming congested.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - Given route O-L-D was chosen by 13 drivers in Round 6 and by 7 drivers in Round 7, it's likely that more drivers might switch to O-R-D in the next round, reacting to the lower number on route O-L-D.
   - I will choose Route O-L-D in the next round as it seems less likely for others to switch back to it immediately after it had higher usage, given the alternate switching pattern seen.

This leads to the decision:

LLM Output:
To decide on the best route choice for the next round, let's analyze the previous rounds' outcomes one by one, and draw insights to help make an informed decision.

### Analysis of Previous Rounds:
1. **Round 1:**
   - **Route Chosen:** O-R-D
   - **Payoff:** 60
   - **Agent Distribution:** O-L-D: 5, O-R-D: 13
   - **Insight:** High agent concentration on O-R-D led to low payoff.
   
2. **Round 2:**
   - **Route Chosen:** O-L-D
   - **Payoff:** 10
   - **Agent Distribution:** O-L-D: 18, O-R-D: 0
   - **Insight:** Choosing the same route as all other agents drastically lowered payoff.

3. **Round 3:**
   - **Route Chosen:** O-R-D
   - **Payoff:** 30
   - **Agent Distribution:** O-L-D: 2, O-R-D: 16
   - **Insight:** Again, high concentration on O-R-D resulted in a low payoff.

4. **Round 4:**
   - **Route Chosen:** O-L-D
   - **Payoff:** 40
   - **Agent Distribution:** O-L-D: 15, O-R-D: 3
   - **Insight:** Lower agent concentration on O-L-D improved payoff.

5. **Round 5:**
   - **Route Chosen:** O-R-D
   - **Payoff:** 40
   - **Agent Distribution:** O-L-D: 3, O-R-D: 15
   - **Insight:** High concentration on O-R-D, resulting in a lower payoff.

6. **Round 6:**
   - **Route Chosen:** O-L-D
   - **Payoff:** 60
   - **Agent Distribution:** O-L-D: 13, O-R-D: 5
   - **Insight:** Moderate concentration on O-L-D yielded a better payoff.

7. **Round 7:**
   - **Route Chosen:** O-R-D
   - **Payoff:** 80
   - **Agent Distribution:** O-L-D: 7, O-R-D: 11
   - **Insight:** Lesser concentration on O-R-D than usual, leading to a higher payoff.

8. **Round 8:**
   - **Route Chosen:** O-L-D
   - **Payoff:** 80
   - **Agent Distribution:** O-L-D: 11, O-R-D: 7
   - **Insight:** Lower than average concentration on O-L-D resulted in high payoff.

### Strategic Decision:
To maximize payoff, it is crucial to:

- Choose the route with fewer agents to minimize congestion.
- Based on agent distribution trends, switching routes when there's a higher concentration on one can lead to higher payoffs.

### Current Decision:
Given the alternating pattern and the better payoff when agent concentration is balanced or when fewer agents select the same route:

**Route Choice for Next Round:**

Analyzing the pattern, both O-L-D and O-R-D are possible contenders. However, payoffs have tended to be slightly more favorable for O-L-D when concentrations are moderate to low. This possibly suggests a pattern of congestion oscillation. Considering the last round's higher payoff with O-L-D, it might be that agents are oscillating back towards O-R-D again. To maximize the likelihood of being on the route with less congestion, I'll choose:

{"route": "O-R-D"}

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide which route to take in the upcoming round, let's analyze the past rounds to identify any patterns or trends in the behavior of the other participants and the corresponding payoffs:

1. **Observation of Payoffs and Choices:**
   - When more participants chose a route, the payoff tended to be lower because costs increased with more drivers on a segment of the route.
   - The best payoffs (80 points) were obtained in rounds 7 and 8, when the number of participants was relatively balanced, with a slight tilt towards the opposite route you chose (11 on O-R-D when you chose O-L-D and 11 on O-L-D when you chose O-R-D).

2. **Analysis of Strategy:**
   - Shifting between routes: Alternating route choices might give a competitive edge by avoiding congestion on either route.
   - Observing current trends: Recently, the alternation in choices (e.g., choosing O-L-D after O-R-D was crowded and vice versa) resulted in relatively good payoffs (60 points in round 9 by choosing O-R-D when 5 agents chose O-L-D).

3. **Trend Analysis and Projection:**
   - Given the historical data, a significant flow shift seems to be a common occurrence. Participants react to the previous round's congestion.
   - The last round saw a repeat situation similar to round 1, where the O-L-D route had only 5 drivers, suggesting a plausible reaction could be an increased number on O-L-D for the upcoming round.

4. **Decision:**
   - Given the effort to maximize payoff and the possibility that participants will act predictably based on previous rounds, shifting choice to the opposite route of the last crowd seems strategic. Since the O-L-D route had only 5 drivers in the last round, there is a risk it may become crowded this time.
   - Assuming participants might overcompensate by switching to O-L-D, and considering the frequent alternation pattern, choosing O-R-D remains a safer bet.

Lastly, the decision based on trend analysis and strategic reasoning should aim to minimize anticipated congestion costs, thus maximizing the payoff.

Therefore, I choose the route **O-R-D**.

- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 8 agents
        O-R-D: 10 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To determine the choice of route for the current round, let's analyze the observations and results from previous rounds. The goal is to maximize the payoff by minimizing the travel cost.

1. **Identify Patterns**:
    - Historically, when the number of agents on O-R-D is lower, the payoff is higher. Conversely, when more agents choose O-R-D, the payoff tends to be lower.
    - Similarly, a lower number of agents on O-L-D can also lead to a higher payoff.

2. **Review Payoffs**:
    - The highest payoffs received were 90 (Round 10, choosing O-R-D with 10 agents), 80 (Round 7, choosing O-R-D with 11 agents), and 80 (Round 8, choosing O-L-D with 11 agents).
    - The lowest payoffs were 10 (Round 2, choosing O-L-D with 18 agents) and 30 (Round 3, choosing O-R-D with 16 agents).

3. **Evaluate Trends**:
    - In recent rounds, alternating between routes (such as in rounds 9 and 10) resulted in higher payoffs when choosing O-R-D with relatively fewer participants.
    - In rounds where both routes had similar participant numbers, such as rounds 7 and 8, both choices produced decent payoffs.

4. **Current Strategy**:
    - Many participants might switch due to a higher number of agents on O-R-D recently. This could create an opportunity on O-R-D if most switch to O-L-D.
    - However, given the good payoff in round 10 with 10 agents on O-R-D, it's reasonable to expect similar or fewer numbers again if the trend continues.

Considering these factors, choosing **O-R-D** again appears favorable for potentially achieving a good balance and maximizing the payoff.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide on the best route for the next round, let's analyze the pattern from previous rounds and evaluate the potential payoffs for each route:

1. **Understand Cost Function and Payoff Calculation:**
   - Route O-L-D: Cost = \(10X + 210\)
   - Route O-R-D: Cost = \(210 + 10Y\)
   - Payoff for each route choice = 400 - Cost

2. **Review of Previous Decisions:**
   - My best payoffs have been when choosing routes with fewer people.
   - I received 80 points for choosing O-R-D with 11 drivers and O-L-D with 11 drivers, which confirms that a more balanced distribution of agents between routes yields higher payoffs.

3. **Trend Analysis:**
   - The highest payoff of 90 was earned on route O-R-D with 10 drivers.
   - Consistent payoffs around 80 points suggest that targeting routes where around 10 to 11 drivers are choosing that same route seems beneficial.

4. **Strategy Moving Forward:**
   - Based on past performance, choosing a route where the congestion is roughly balanced with around 10 to 11 agents seems optimal in terms of maximizing payoff.
   - O-R-D often appears to be a good choice with a fair distribution of agents that allows higher payoffs.
5. **Decision:**
   - Given the recent trend and the analysis from the previous rounds, I will choose the route O-R-D, which has historically been less congested in terms of maximizing payoff when properly balanced.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision on which route to choose, let's analyze the pattern and payoff in previous rounds:

1. **Round Analysis:** 
   - High payoff rounds with route O-R-D: Rounds 7 (80), 10 (90), 11 (80), 12 (110).
   - High payoff rounds with route O-L-D: Round 8 (80).
   - Moderate payoff routes: Mixed, mostly when traffic is balanced.

2. **Traffic Observation:**
   - When the number of agents on O-R-D is lower, the payoff tends to be higher.
   - Conversely, O-L-D can also be profitable but usually when the number of agents choosing it is slightly lower or when O-R-D is more crowded.

3. **Traffic Fluctuation:**
   - There's a tendency for agents to switch between routes. Both routes have experienced relatively high and low traffic at different times.

4. **Decision Based on Payoff Trends:**
   - Recently, choosing O-R-D has favored higher payoffs (Round 10: 90, 11: 80, 12: 110).
   - Although O-L-D provided a payoff of 80 in Round 8, the consistency of O-R-D recently tips the favorability scale towards it.

5. **Predictive Decision Making:**
   - Anticipate that fewer agents may switch to O-L-D due to the higher recent success of O-R-D. This can make O-L-D less crowded and potentially more profitable.
   - However, it's reasonable to assume that slight variations and randomness persist, so sticking to O-R-D could remain a safe choice given recent trends.

Based on the above analysis, I would recommend choosing route `O-R-D` again to capitalize on the consistent recent outcomes. Here is your choice in JSON format:

Review of Previous Rounds:

1. **Routes with Payoffs:**
   - O-R-D gave better payoffs when fewer people chose it (e.g., rounds 7, 10, 12) compared to when more people chose it (e.g., rounds 1, 3, 5).
   - O-L-D gave better payoffs when fewer people chose it as well, but in the past rounds, O-R-D had generally provided better payoffs on average.

2. **Behavior Trends:**
   - More agents tending to move to O-L-D when payoffs on O-R-D decrease and vice versa.
   - Rounds 10, 11, 12, and 13 show a relatively balanced distribution between both routes, with O-R-D offering better payoffs on average than O-L-D.
   - O-R-D seems to be a safer choice because, based on recent rounds, its payoff has been reasonably consistent when the number of agents choosing it is lower than, equal to, or just slightly greater than those choosing O-L-D.

3. **Risk Assessment:**
   - O-R-D is less affected if few more people join compared to O-L-D due to its consistent pattern.
   - The balancing trend observed in the last few rounds offers a chance that both routes might have around equal distribution, favoring O-R-D in terms of optimal payoff.

Decision: Considering the observed trends and aiming for stability and potentially higher payoff with moderate number of agents, I will choose the route that is likely to be chosen by less than 10 drivers this time considering past behavior points towards O-R-D often 'recovering' after few lower payoff periods and yielding better or comparable results in mixed rounds.

Choose the route 'O-R-D'.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a well-reasoned decision, let's analyze the previous rounds and the cost structure:

1. **Cost versus Payoff Analysis**:
   - The endowment is 400 points.
   - Costs on O-L-D: 10X + 210.
   - Costs on O-R-D: 210 + 10Y.
   - Payoff = Endowment (400) - Travel Cost.

2. **Summary of Payoff Outcomes**:
   - Higher payoffs occurred generally when the number of agents on the chosen route was lower.
   - O-R-D choices:
     - Under 11 agents on R-D produced payoffs of 80 or more (Rounds 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14).
   - O-L-D choices:
     - Payoff of 80 when 11 agents used O-L-D (Round 8).

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - Alternating pattern in competing use of the routes around the midpoint suggests some periodic switching.
   - In the most recent rounds, O-R-D showed consistently higher payoff, especially when agents were split more evenly or weighed more towards O-L-D.

4. **Current Trend Observation**:
   - The last rounds have seen either a balance or more agents on O-L-D.

5. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Choosing a more balanced approach historically led to better payoffs.
   - Recent consistency points towards O-R-D being moderately less crowded.

Based on the analyzed information:

- **Strategy**: Choosing 'O-R-D' seems favorable under current trends given the prior performance and likelihood of fewer agents on this route relative to O-L-D.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To determine the optimal route for the next round, let's analyze the previous rounds' results and observe any patterns or strategic decisions:

1. **Review of Past Rounds**:
   - You had the highest payoffs in rounds where the distribution of agents between the two routes was more balanced, specifically when the difference in the number of agents between O-L-D and O-R-D was small (Rounds 10 through 15).
   - Rounds 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 show a balanced distribution with relatively high payoffs, particularly when the distribution was 9-9. Your choice in these rounds was consistently O-R-D.

2. **Observation on Route Costs**:
   - The cost for O-R-D fluctuates significantly with the number of agents choosing it, affecting your payoff. However, the fixed portions of both routes are equal, creating a baseline comparison.
   - You have had better payoffs recently when choosing O-R-D, especially in scenarios with balanced agent distribution.

3. **Strategic Insights**:
   - Recent rounds suggest a trend or equilibrium where the participating agents are balancing between both routes, likely due to recognizing patterns in payoffs.
   - Sticking with O-R-D seems advantageous when predictors indicate relatively balanced or fewer agents choosing this route. This ensures you have a higher payoff due to the fixed lower cost when fewer drivers opt for O-R-D.

4. **Decision Point**:
    - Given the high payoffs from round 11 to 15 and the observed balance in agent numbers, choosing route O-R-D again seems the most strategic decision unless abnormal fluctuations in agent distribution occur.
    
Based on this analysis, I suggest continuing with the route O-R-D for the next round. This choice is based on the assumption that the recent balanced distribution will persist or improve, maximizing your potential payoff.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision about which route to choose for the next round, let's analyze the given data from previous rounds:

**Key Observations:**

1. **Payoff Calculation:**
   - For route **O-L-D**: Cost = 10 * (number of agents on O-L) + 210.
   - For route **O-R-D**: Cost = 210 + 10 * (number of agents on R-D).
   - Payoff = 400 - Cost.

2. **Route Analysis:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** Payoffs received were lower when more agents chose this route (Rounds 2 and 4), but higher payoffs when fewer agents chose it (Round 8 where payoff was 80).
   - **Route O-R-D:** Tends to provide better payoffs when a lower number of agents chose it. The best payoffs were observed in Round 12 and 10 when the split was below 10 agents each way.

3. **Trends and Patterns:**
   - Your payoffs were generally higher when you chose the route with fewer agents.
   - When the split between agents on O-L-D and O-R-D becomes closer, the payoffs improved (e.g., Round 10, 12, 13, 14, 15).

4. **Decision Strategy:**
   - Aim for the route with potentially fewer expected agents.
   - Given recent rounds from 10 to 16 are all leaning towards a more even split but more on O-R-D, considering that you had higher payoffs when you went with O-R-D recently might imply others might switch thinking similar to acquire felt benefit.

**Recommendation:**
- You could choose **O-L-D** for the next round, given that agents might start leaning slightly towards O-R-D after you taking it frequently. 

Therefore, for the upcoming round, I would choose:

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
Let's analyze the information from the previous rounds to guide our decision-making:

1. **Payoff Goal**: We want to maximize our payoff, which means minimizing the travel cost.
2. **Endowment**: We know that each round starts with an endowment of 400 points, and we want to keep as much of this as possible.
3. **Travel Cost Formula**:
   - For route O-L-D: Cost = 10X + 210.
   - For route O-R-D: Cost = 210 + 10Y.
4. **Analysis of Past Rounds**:
   - **Higher payoffs** were achieved when route O-R-D had closer or fewer number of participants as route O-L-D.
   - When you chose O-R-D and had fewer agents (or an equal split), your payoffs were often higher.
   - Generally, higher payoffs on O-R-D when the number of agents choosing it was no more than 10.
5. **Optimal Strategy**: From a strategic standpoint, choosing O-R-D can lead to better outcomes if we anticipate fewer participants on that route or at least an even split.

For the next round, considering this analysis and assuming the trends might continue, an optimal strategy could involve selecting route O-R-D, especially given recent trends where choosing this option when numbers were balanced or favorable led to higher payoffs.

Based on this thought process, the decision is:

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision about which route to choose in the upcoming round, let's analyze the patterns from the summary of previous rounds and the resulting payoffs:

1. **Understanding the Cost Structure**:
   - Route `O-L-D`: Cost = 10X + 210
   - Route `O-R-D`: Cost = 210 + 10Y

2. **Identifying Past Trends**:
   - When the O-R-D route has 10 or fewer agents, payoffs are often higher (ex: Rounds 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15 when making the choice resulted in a payoff of 90 or more).
   - Conversely, the O-R-D route tends to yield lower payoffs when crowded, such as in Round 1 (13 agents, payoff of 60), and Round 3 (16 agents, payoff of 30).
   - The O-L-D route has sometimes offered favorable payoffs when it had around 10 agents, as seen in Round 6 with a payoff of 60 (13 agents) and Round 17 with a payoff of 90 (10 agents).

3. **Recent Observations**:
   - In the last couple of rounds, O-R-D was chosen frequently with fewer than 10 other agents (Round 18: 10 agents), resulting in a payoff of 90.
   - Earlier rounds indicated a competitive balance where the number of agents on each route would equalize around 9 each, providing decent payoffs (Round 13, 14, 15).

4. **Optimizing the Next Choice**:
   - Based on these observations, the O-R-D route was often more profitable when agents choosing it were fewer or equal compared to the O-L-D route.
   - The recent trend in the last few rounds (Round 12 through 18) showed a pattern of alternating routes, aiming for evenly distributed number of agents or fewer agents on O-R-D for higher payoffs.

5. **Strategic Decision**:
   - Assume that many participants noticed similar patterns, leading them to switch routes aiming to balance or crowd one less. The tendency leans towards making more participants shift to O-L-D after visible cumulative favorable outcomes when O-R-D is less crowded.
   - Thus, anticipating potential influx into O-L-D or a balance shift, choosing O-R-D again may give a strategic edge unless too many others adopt similar adaptive strategies.

Given these step-by-step considerations, I will opt for the route `O-R-D` as it seems likely to yield a higher payoff based on recent patterns and anticipated shifts by others.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
Based on the information you've provided from the previous rounds, we need to analyze patterns to make an informed decision for this round. Here are some observations:

1. **Payoff Comparison**: 
   - When choosing route O-R-D, your payoffs tend to be higher when fewer people choose the same route. Notably, when the distribution between the routes was more balanced (like 9 agents on each route), you received a payoff of 100.
   - For route O-L-D, you have received a payoff as high as 90 when the number of agents choosing the same route was around 10.

2. **Route O-R-D Selection Trends**:
   - Frequent selection of O-R-D by you, with payoffs ranging from 30 to 110.
   - The payoffs are generally higher when the selection is balanced between O-L-D and O-R-D.

3. **Route O-L-D Selection Trends**:
   - Fewer instances of you choosing this route, yet it has delivered relatively higher payoffs when chosen more strategically.

4. **Observation of Opponents' Choices**:
   - The number of agents on O-R-D varies but often trends slightly higher than those on O-L-D.
   - The trend shows an equal or higher number of agents choosing O-R-D more often than not.

5. **Round Stability**:
   - The last few rounds have seen a consistent number of agents balancing the selection across both routes, indicating more stable routes and predictable outcomes.

**Decision Strategy**:
- Considering the pattern in recent rounds, selecting a route where your competitors are split relatively evenly might yield better payoffs. Balance in choices seems beneficial, considering the payoff of 100 when the agents were split 9-9.

Given that recent rounds have shown an equilibrium of 9-9 participants leading to a payoff of 100, and fewer participants leaning towards O-L-D might be a safer option for this round to maximize payoff. However, keep an eye on the flow and be flexible if everyone shifts their strategy.

With this analysis, I recommend choosing **route O-R-D** this round, keeping in mind the historical data where it provided reasonably high and stable payoffs.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision, let's evaluate the outcomes of previous rounds and strategize accordingly.

1. **Trends in Payoffs**:
   - **O-R-D Route**: Frequent shifts in agents, with payoffs ranging from 30 to 110. The highest payoff (110) was obtained when there were fewer participants (8) on this route.
   - **O-L-D Route**: Payoffs varied; however, participating agents have generally been in a wider range from 2 to 18 across rounds.

2. **Agent Distribution and Optimal Payoff**:
   - The route O-R-D consistently granted higher payoffs when the participant count was below or equal to 9, yielding up to 110 points.
   - The distribution appears to level off at around 9 participants for O-R-D leading to better payoffs.

3. **Prediction and Decision Making**:
   - Recent rounds have shown a near-even split between the two routes, particularly with both O-L-D and O-R-D having 9 agents in several rounds (Rounds 13-15, 19).
   - Prioritizing O-R-D when 9 or fewer agents seem to join has been beneficial.

4. **Next Move Strategy**:
   - With consistent oscillation and past payoffs in mind, opting for the O-R-D route gives a strategic edge, especially when anticipating an equilibrium state close to 9 participants per route.
   - If the O-R-D route nears 9 or fewer agents, the potential for a higher payoff increases.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Opt to choose the O-R-D route, expecting a continued equilibrium state or lower concentration of participants similar to historical data, maximizing potential payoffs.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision on which route to choose, let's analyze the previous rounds:

1. **Identify Patterns**:
   - The payoff is generally higher when the route I choose has fewer participants.
   - For route **O-R-D**:
     - High payoffs (80 and above) were observed when the count was around 8 to 10 participants (e.g., Rounds 12, 13, 14, 15, 19). 
     - Moderate payoffs (60-70) were noted when participants were around 12-13 (e.g., Rounds 1, 3, 9, 16).
   - For route **O-L-D**:
     - High payoff of 90 observed when there were around 10 participants (Round 17).
     - Lower payoff of 10 when all participants (18) chose this route (Round 2).

2. **Trends in Participant Choices**:
   - There's been an alternating pattern between the routes:
     - Some rounds, the majority choose O-R-D; in other rounds, they switch, likely influenced by previous payoffs.
   - Recently, O-R-D was chosen more frequently in the last few rounds with varying counts between 8 to 13.

3. **Decision Based on Trends**:
   - If I notice a pattern shift where fewer participants are opting for O-L-D after many have previously been choosing O-R-D, it might be a good opportunity to switch to O-L-D for a potentially higher payoff.

Based on this step-by-step analysis, the prudent choice would be to select the route that currently appears underutilized by other participants, considering the alternating pattern. Given the recent slight preference towards route O-R-D, there might be a trend shift. However, seeing the last round's balance between routes, sticking with O-R-D could be stable unless drastic audience shifts are identified.

Thus, the next logical route to choose is:

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make the best decision regarding which route to choose in the upcoming round, let's analyze the situation based on the patterns we have seen in the previous rounds. 

### Analysis of Previous Rounds:

1. **Route Decisions and Payoffs**:
   - We've tried both routes multiple times and observed different levels of payoff.
   - Lowest payoff on O-L-D is 10 (Round 2).
   - Highest payoff on O-L-D is 90 (Round 17).
   - Lowest payoff on O-R-D is 30 (Round 3).
   - Highest payoff on O-R-D is 110 (Rounds 12, 21).

2. **Frequency and Distribution**:
   - **O-L-D**:
     - Typically chosen less frequently by other drivers, often resulting in higher congestion when chosen (proven by significantly low payoff in Round 2 when all chose this).
     - Payoffs vary significantly based on how many others choose it.
   - **O-R-D**:
     - Chosen more consistently with mixed results; a balance between participants more often.

3. **Recent Trends**:
   - Last times (Round 21, 22), O-R-D provided decent payoffs (110, 90).
   - Mixed choice patterns around these rounds indicate a potential shift in driver strategy, but O-R-D seems balanced.

4. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - **Balancing**: If the routes are balanced (e.g., 9 on each side), payoffs tend to stabilize, allowing us potentially to secure higher than average payoffs if we choose carefully.
   - **Risk Assessment**: Given the history, O-R-D has had more stable and higher average payoffs since congestion impacts this route less due to the last segment's fixed cost.

### Conclusion:

Based on the data and patterns, choosing **O-R-D** is statistically more reliable given past stability and rewards. This is consistent with avoiding congestion from when the number on route O-R-D is balanced or less congested than O-L-D.

Thus, the strategic choice for the upcoming round is:

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To determine the optimal route choice for the next round, we need to consider the impact of the distribution of drivers on each route and how it affects the travel cost, and thus the payoff. Here are the key points to consider from the performance data:

1. **Payoff and Driver Distribution:** 
   - When the number of drivers on both routes is more balanced (around 8-10 drivers on each), the payoff tends to be higher (e.g., rounds with payoffs of 90-110).
   - A very skewed distribution (e.g., most drivers choosing one route) generally leads to lower payoffs for those on the busier route.

2. **Route Analysis:**
   - **O-R-D:** In past rounds, when you've been on this route, payoffs vary depending on driver distribution. However, several rounds with about 8-10 drivers on O-R-D resulted in decent payoffs (around 90-110), and this route provided consistently better payoffs in comparison to O-L-D when you considered past rounds.
   - **O-L-D:** There are several instances (such as round 2 and round 4) where choosing this route resulted in either a minimal payoff or a very unbalanced driver distribution, leading to high costs.

3. **Trends and Patterns:**
   - The distribution seems to oscillate and stabilize around a fairly balanced level, with each round sometimes briefly deviating and causing a drop in payoff.
   - Predictable patterns suggest that when a route gets crowded in a previous round, players tend to switch, causing fluctuations.

Given these observations, the best strategy appears to be choosing the route that in recent rounds (like round 21) provided high payoffs when there was a similar number of drivers on both sides or the ones that had slightly more drivers on O-L-D.

With these points in mind, a sensible choice would be to stay with the route O-R-D as it has consistently provided better payoffs in situations that can likely occur in upcoming rounds under normal fluctuations.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision about the route selection for the next round, let's analyze the data from previous rounds:

1. **Route Payoff Analysis:**
   - The payoff is highest when fewer agents choose the same route as I do. My payoffs have varied significantly based on the distribution of agents on each route.
   - I received a high payoff of 150 when 4 agents, including myself, chose the O-R-D route in Round 24.
   - In Rounds 13-15, when I chose O-R-D, the payoff was consistently 100 with 9 agents on each route.
   - In Round 12, choosing O-R-D also yielded a high payoff of 110 when 8 agents chose O-R-D.

2. **Route Selection Trends:**
   - There is some balance between the number of agents choosing O-L-D and O-R-D, but with certain spikes and changes.
   - Recent rounds (e.g., Round 24) show that switching between routes can result in a high payoff, like how Round 24 had only 4 agents on O-R-D.

3. **Strategy Evaluation:**
   - A consistent preference for O-R-D seems to have worked while adjusting based on the number of agents on each route.
   - The key is to anticipate a lower number of players choosing the same route as I do.

4. **Decision Making for Next Round:**
   - Given that O-L-D had a significant number of agents (14) in Round 24, there might be an inclination for some players to switch routes based on prior observations, which would make O-R-D potentially less populated in the upcoming round.
   - The consistent choice of O-R-D has resulted in reasonably good payoffs overall.

Considering these observations, choosing **Route O-R-D** seems to still strategically offer the potential for a better payoff based on recent patterns and balancing. This decision aims to leverage lower expected competition while observing potential patterns of distribution from past rounds.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make the decision for the next round, we need to analyze the trends from the previous rounds and consider how the number of agents affects the payoff for each route:

1. **Payoff Calculation**: 
   - For route O-L-D, the travel cost is \(10 \times \text{agents on O-L-D} + 210\).
   - For route O-R-D, the travel cost is \(210 + 10 \times \text{agents on O-R-D}\).
   - Your payoff is calculated by subtracting the travel cost from the initial endowment of 400.

2. **Observations**:
   - Historical round payoffs suggest that payoffs are higher when there is a more balanced distribution of agents between the two routes.
   - Particularly high payoffs were received in rounds where you chose O-R-D and the distribution was close to balanced (like round 24).
   - Conversely, when there is a heavy imbalance towards the current choice, like a high number of agents choosing the same route, the payoffs tend to decrease due to increased congestion costs.

3. **Trend Analysis**:
   - When O-R-D has 8 to 10 agents, the payoff has been consistently good (e.g., rounds 12, 18, 22).
   - When more than 12 agents take the same route as you, payoffs generally drop unless the alternative route has significantly more agents.

4. **Decision Making**:
   - To maximize payoff, the goal is to predict the least congested path or the path with a balanced number of agents.
   - Given historical data, when about 8-10 agents choose O-R-D, the payoffs have been generally favorable. Assuming others will adjust strategies slightly to balance due to consistent low payoffs on heavily imbalanced routes, choosing O-R-D might lead to a reasonable number of competing agents, leading to a potentially better payoff.
   
Thus, for the next round, based on this analysis, it seems that choosing route **O-R-D** is the optimal strategy.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision about which route to take in the upcoming round, we should analyze the data from previous rounds to identify patterns that maximize payoff.

1. **Observations on Payoffs:**
   - When the number of drivers on O-R-D is fewer, the payoff tends to be higher. For example, in Round 24 with 4 drivers on O-R-D, the payoff was 150.
   - Conversely, when many drivers choose O-R-D, the payoffs drop, sometimes as low as 50 or 60 when there were 14 to 16 drivers.

2. **Balance and Equilibrium:**
   - Payoffs tend to stabilize around 90 to 110 when there's an even split (roughly 9 to 10 drivers per route). 
   - This indicates a semblance of Nash Equilibrium where both routes yield similar costs due to equal distribution of drivers.

3. **Alternative Route Costs:**
   - Route O-L-D has fluctuated more in driver count, particularly experiencing more extreme counts (as high as 18 and as low as 0 drivers), causing high variability in individual costs.

4. **Adapting Strategy:**
   - Given the observed stable payoff when choosing O-R-D especially when O-L-D has around 8 to 10 drivers, it indicates a relatively lower risk as more rounds have achieved fairer payoffs this way.
   - O-R-D offers a potential safety net in scenarios where O-L-D gets overcrowded suddenly, leading to low payoff.

Based on the above observations, for this upcoming round, it seems strategic to choose route O-R-D, optimizing for the likelihood of the more predictable payoff.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision for the next round, let's analyze the patterns and payoffs from previous rounds:

1. **Route Trends and Payoffs:**
   - **Route O-R-D:** Most rounds, particularly when the number of agents choosing O-R-D is close to 8-10, resulted in higher payoffs, often around 90 to 110 points. 
   - **Route O-L-D:** When I chose this route, the payoff varied greatly. High congestion, when more than 10 agents chose O-L-D, significantly reduced the payoff.

2. **Identify Patterns:**
   - **Balanced Rounds:** Rounds with an equal or nearly equal distribution between O-L-D and O-R-D tend to stabilize the payoff (e.g., rounds with 9 agents each on both routes).
   - **Extreme Cases:** Extremely unbalanced agent choice (e.g., 13 agents on O-R-D) typically results in lower payoffs, unless on the less congested route.

3. **Round Recurrence:**
   - Choosing O-R-D has historically been less risky with a payoff often above 80, except when agents on O-R-D were exceptionally high.
   - The pattern doesn’t suggest extreme shifts or strategies by the other participants.

4. **Risk Management:**
   - Aiming for a round where the number of agents choosing routes is closer to an even split, or slightly higher on O-L-D if choosing O-R-D, generally maximizes the payoff.
   
Given these observations, the safest and most profitable strategy, based on past data, is to choose route O-R-D. It frequently assures a payoff within the acceptable range as long as it does not become overly congested. Historically, there is a recurring inclination of fewer agents on route O-L-D, making O-R-D a promising choice for better payoff equilibrium.

Therefore, I will choose route O-R-D for the next round.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
Given the historical data from the previous rounds, let's analyze the situation and think step-by-step to determine the best route choice.

1. **Understanding Payoffs and Costs:**
   - The payoff equals the endowment (400) minus the total travel cost.
   - Travel costs for each segment depend on the number of drivers on them.
   - Segment costs:
     - O-L: 10 * number of drivers on O-L
     - R-D: 10 * number of drivers on R-D
     - L-D and O-R are fixed costs of 210 each.

2. **Patterns and Observations:**
   - High payoffs (110, 150) occurred when choosing O-R-D, often when fewer people took this route.
   - Low payoffs generally resulted from O-R-D being more crowded (more drivers choosing this route).

3. **Calculating Costs:**
   - If choosing O-L-D, the cost is 10 * X (drivers on O-L) + 210.
   - If choosing O-R-D, the cost is 210 + 10 * Y (drivers on R-D).

4. **Round Performance Recap:**
   - Better payoffs with O-R-D when fewer drivers choose it.
   - O-L-D sometimes yields better payoffs when O-R-D is crowded, but less frequently.

5. **Strategic Choice:**
   - The data imply that when O-R-D is less crowded (less than or equal to 8 drivers), you receive a higher payoff.
   - If current trends persist, predict the allocation of drivers based on recent rounds (especially if O-R-D seems to be constantly crowded).

6. **Historical Route Preference:**
   - More often, participants seem to prefer O-R-D.
   - The rounds with 14 drivers on O-R-D indicate possible crowding trends or adjustments by others.

7. **Decision for the Next Round:**
   - Given this decision involves uncertainty, and without knowing the strategies of the others, we should lean towards maximizing expected payoff.
   - If the trend of participants adjusting to historical crowding persists, and assuming some variability in strategies, choosing O-R-D might often favor high payoffs due to lower expected congestion when fewer than 9 drivers choose it.

Analyzing all factors and the balance of crowd dynamics:
- I would choose the route that has historically delivered the higher payoffs when the distribution shifts slightly.
- Based on previous patterns and expected strategic adjustments, I would opt for route O-R-D.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide which route to choose for the next round, let's analyze the data from the previous rounds:

1. **Payoff Patterns:** We have received higher payoffs primarily when the number of agents is balanced on both routes. The highest payoffs (110, 120, and 150) occurred when the number of drivers on O-R-D was relatively low (8 or 4 drivers), and when you chose O-R-D alongside few users, or when O-L-D was quite crowded. 

2. **Route O-R-D:** Generally, when more drivers choose this route, our payoff is lower. Rounds with payoffs of 50, 60, 70, etc., occurred when O-R-D had 12-14 drivers. Given this, it seems unfavorable to choose O-R-D when anticipating high traffic on this route.

3. **Route O-L-D:** We also see that when we chose O-L-D when it had a significant number of agents (over 10), our payoff decreased, resulting in as low as 10.

4. **Balanced Choices:** Observing rounds where both routes had roughly 9 drivers, the payoff was consistently around 100 (rounds 13, 14, 15, 19). This behavior suggests a more steady and somewhat optimal scenario for ensuring a decent payoff.

5. **Identifying Patterns:** Recently (rounds 24 and 29), higher payoffs occurred when choosing O-R-D and traffic balanced more towards O-L-D, indicating that when O-R-D is less crowded or there is a shift of high load towards O-L-D, choosing O-R-D yielded better outcomes. 

### Decision Strategy:

- Given the recent trends, choosing **O-R-D** seems more advantageous when we anticipate or have observed a shift of more drivers towards O-L-D, hoping it remains less populated in the upcoming round.
  
- A route that was recently advantageous might build confidence in other agents to switch, so anticipating that O-L-D might attract more drivers again, we should opt for O-R-D in the upcoming round.

Based on this analysis and anticipation of repeated behavior in these dynamic but slightly predictable settings, the strategy would be to go with:

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
Based on the summary of previous rounds, let's analyze the data to make an informed decision:

1. **Cost and Choices Analysis**:
   - Route `O-R-D` has a fixed cost of 210 for segment O-R and a variable cost based on the number of agents for segment R-D.
   - Route `O-L-D` has a variable cost based on the number of agents for segment O-L and a fixed cost of 210 for segment L-D.

2. **Performance Observation**:
   - **Route O-R-D**: You have received payoffs ranging from 30 to 150. The payoff is higher when fewer agents choose this route. Optimal payoffs occur when the number of drivers is low.
   - **Route O-L-D**: Whenever chosen, the payoffs received have been lower or have not been consistently optimal compared to when `O-R-D` has been chosen with fewer agents.

3. **Balancing Agent Distribution**:
   - It seems you have achieved higher payoffs when the total on `O-R-D` was lower or evenly balanced with `O-L-D`. In cases where the balance was near 9-9 or fewer agents on `O-R-D`, payoffs were high.

4. **Current Strategy**:
   - Given past results, there is a recurring pattern where choosing `O-R-D` offers more stable payoffs especially when there is a balance in the distribution of agents between the two routes.
   - In rounds where all or an overwhelming majority chose one route (`O-L-D` in round 2 for instance), the result was poor.

Given the trends and information deduced, the strategy would be to continue choosing `O-R-D` while the number of agents on that route has varied results but appears better matched when fewer than 13 drivers are on it. The rounds with fair distribution close to 9-9, seem consistent for decent outcomes.

Therefore, choosing route `O-R-D` appears reasonable based on this analytical deduction.

To decide which route to choose next, I'll analyze the data from the previous rounds. The key is to find a balance between minimizing costs and maximizing the number of agents to choose the opposite route to exploit lower costs.

1. **Payoff Analysis:**
   - The payoff seems highest when fewer agents choose the same route as I do.
   - High payoffs are observed when I choose O-R-D and the number of participants is low (e.g., Round 24, payoff 150, 4 agents on O-R-D).

2. **Agent Distribution:**
   - When numbers are balanced (e.g., 9-9 split), payoffs tend to be moderate.
   - When the numbers are skewed towards O-L-D, choosing O-R-D gives better results unless too many people also choose O-R-D.

3. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - O-R-D has been chosen more frequently and generally provides better payoffs when fewer agents choose it.
   - Payoffs were generally lower when choosing O-L-D due to more participants choosing the same route.

4. **Recent Rounds:**
   - In recent rounds (e.g., Round 31), O-R-D with fewer agents providing a payoff of 130 suggests that fewer agents on O-R-D continues to be advantageous. However, when choosing O-R-D when it's congested (e.g., Round 28 and 30), the payoff decreases.

5. **Strategy Moving Forward:**
   - Based on historical data, trying to predict and choose the less congested route can lead to a higher payoff.
   - The trend suggests people might now be more inclined to move toward O-L-D due to recent high traffic on O-R-D. 

Therefore, considering these points, the strategic choice for the next round is to go with the less chosen route historically:

- **Chosen Route:** `O-R-D`

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision on which route to choose, the following observations and strategies can be considered:

1. **Payoff Evaluation**:
   - The payoff is maximized when fewer agents choose the same route as you. 
   - Recent rounds indicate that a high payoff is achieved on the O-R-D route when L has more agents (e.g., Round 24, Round 29, Round 31 etc.).

2. **Trend Analysis**:
   - There have been frequent fluctuations in agent distribution across the two routes.
   - Rounds with roughly equal distribution (e.g., 9 and 9 or 8 and 10) often provide moderate payoffs.

3. **Route Popularity**:
   - O-R-D has been the more popular choice; given this popularity, choosing it during rounds when fewer agents pick it (adjusting to the overall number on L) is essential for maximizing payoff.

4. **Adaptation to Patterns**:
   - In times when few agents chose O-R-D, individuals benefitted more.
   - Previous rounds suggest trying O-L-D occasionally might provide a higher payoff due to less congestion.

5. **Decision**:
   - Given the current analysis and trying to predict the behavior of other participants, opting for the less congested route in the previous round (assuming agent dynamics follow recent patterns) could be advantageous. 

Therefore, considering the tendency for agents to pile onto the route that was chosen heavily recently, and noticing the frequent dense choice of O-R-D, going with O-L-D potentially minimizes competitors on that route leading to a lower cost.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide between the routes O-L-D and O-R-D, let's analyze the data given from previous rounds.

Here are some key points:

1. **Payoff Patterns**: 
   - The payoff depends inversely on the number of drivers on the chosen route.
   - Generally, choosing a route with fewer drivers has yielded higher payoffs.
   - You received high payoffs (90 or above) when choosing O-R-D, especially when the number of drivers on O-R-D was relatively low (around 8-10 drivers).

2. **Distribution of Drivers**:
   - In recent rounds, the number of drivers on O-R-D has varied, but there have been instances where choosing O-R-D paid off well when it wasn't overcrowded.
   - Rounds with fewer drivers on O-L-D gave you lower payoffs on O-R-D, but those have been less frequent recently.

3. **Recent Rounds Trends**:
   - In rounds 31 and 29, when you chose O-R-D, there were significantly more drivers on O-L-D, resulting in high payoffs for you.
   - In round 33, you received a payoff of 60 for choosing O-L-D due to 13 drivers taking that route, while only 5 drivers took O-R-D.

4. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Based on recent trends, the O-R-D route has provided more opportunities for higher payoffs when there are fewer drivers.
   - The balance of drivers has often fluctuated but seems to lean slightly towards more drivers on O-R-D in earlier rounds.

Given these observations, the decision should aim to capitalize on a potential reduction in the number of drivers on O-R-D compared to past rounds to maximize payoff. Thus, you should consider choosing the route where there is the likelihood of a balance shift favorable to you.

Given the analysis, I would choose:

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an optimal decision for the next round, let's analyze the trends and outcomes from the previous rounds step-by-step:

1. **Understanding Payoffs:**
   - Payoff is calculated based on the travel cost deducted from a fixed endowment of 400 points.
   - The cost structure for the routes is:
     - O-L-D: 10X + 210
     - O-R-D: 210 + 10Y
   - High payoff corresponds to lower total travel costs, indicating low congestion on the chosen route or both routes being balanced.

2. **Observations from Previous Rounds:**
   - **O-L-D Route:** Payoffs seemed reasonably good (e.g., Round 33 payoff of 60 with 13 agents, Round 8 payoff of 80 with 11 agents).
   - **O-R-D Route:** Some high payoffs (e.g., Round 31 payoff of 130 with 6 agents, Round 29 payoff of 120 with 7 agents) were achieved when the route had a lower number of drivers.

3. **Balancing Routes:**
   - Rounds where drivers were split more evenly or slightly favored one route provided higher payoffs (e.g., Round 13, 14, 15 with 9 on each route gave about 100 payoffs).

4. **Strategy Consideration:**
   - Aim for balance or slightly fewer drivers on the chosen route as these situations provided higher payoffs.
   - Trends indicate O-R-D was more popular, yet when more drivers shifted to O-L-D, the O-R-D route yielded high payoffs.

5. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - Recent rounds (Round 32 - 34) saw a heavier inclination towards O-R-D except Round 33. When congestion slightly increased on O-L-D in Round 33, a balanced distribution led to a reasonable payoff.
   - Participants' behavior often oscillates based on previous outcomes; a recent high O-R-D congestion might prompt a shift back to O-L-D.

6. **Choosing the Optimal Route:**
   - Expect many to potentially switch back to O-L-D due to the consistent high numbers on O-R-D recently.
   - High O-R-D congestion in previous rounds, with potential driver shifts, suggests aiming for O-L-D which might be less crowded now.

**Decision:**

Based on this analysis, I would choose the route "O-L-D" to potentially capitalize on a shift in driver preferences and get a higher payoff by avoiding possible congestion on O-R-D.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision on which route to choose, let's analyze the data from previous rounds:

1. **Balance of Choices**: There seems to be a general pattern where the distribution of drivers between the two routes is roughly balanced, with fluctuations between more drivers on either route. However, certain rounds have shown that one route can occasionally be favored much more than the other, leading to better payoffs for those who chose the less crowded route.

2. **Payoff Analysis**: A higher payoff is received when fewer drivers choose the same route. Maximum observed payoff seems to occur when the chosen route is less congested:
   - High payoffs (like 150, 130, 120) occurred when the number of drivers on the chosen route was fewer. 
   - Conversely, lower payoffs happened when a lot of drivers chose the same route, reaching 16 agents on O-R-D in some rounds.

3. **Pattern Recognition**: 
   - In rounds where O-R-D was chosen more heavily (e.g., 16 agents), the payoff decreased significantly.
   - When the number of participants on O-R-D dropped around 6, 7 or 8, the payoffs increased substantially.
   - O-L-D tends to become congested when many drivers switch, but switching in less-obvious rounds can lead to higher rewards.

4. **Optimal Strategy**: Ideally, aim for a route with fewer agents. As most rounds see a fluctuating number of agents on routes, predicting a less congested route is tricky but potentially rewarding:
   - The recent history suggests alternating preferences, with both routes experiencing heavier traffic in turns.
   - In contrast to short and frequent switches, staying on or switching to a typically less congested route after a pattern of congestion consolidation could be beneficial.
  
Given these considerations, it would be logical to assess the trend of the past few rounds and strategically choose the route that appears less followed in recent turns. Since O-L-D had only 3 agents twice in the last five rounds (rounds 34 and 29), but then saw increased numbers (13 in rounds 33 and 35), it might see a decrease in the forthcoming round. Meanwhile, O-R-D, with recently consistent high numbers (13 and 11), could see a drop.

Based on this analysis, a calculated risk could be to choose **route O-L-D** in the upcoming round, as it might be less congested if other participants are currently favoring O-R-D.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide which route to choose, let's analyze the previous rounds:

1. Analysis of Payoffs:
   - The payoffs for choosing O-R-D tend to vary significantly depending on the balance of drivers between the routes.
   - High payoffs (>100) occur when there are more drivers on O-L-D, specifically when there are at least 9 drivers or more on O-L-D.
   - Payoffs are consistently poor (<60) when many drivers choose O-R-D.

2. Analysis of Traffic Patterns:
   - O-R-D receives high traffic (10 or more drivers) more frequently than O-L-D.
   - There are some rounds where O-L-D had fewer drivers (3 to 6), resulting in better payoffs for those on O-R-D.

3. Optimal Route Strategy:
   - When O-L-D has 9 or more drivers, O-R-D offers a higher payoff.
   - Since drivers make decisions based on past results, they might expect high traffic on the route with a previously low driver count.

4. Recent Round Observations:
   - Earlier rounds showed better payoffs for selecting O-R-D, particularly when 9 or more drivers chose O-L-D.
   - More recently, there’s been a better balance (around 9-9 split).

Considering this analysis, a strategic choice would be to select the O-R-D route, with the expectation that a slightly larger number of drivers might choose O-L-D in the upcoming round, balancing the routes around the mid-range split. This should potentially yield a decent payoff if my assumption holds.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision on which route to choose in the next round, let's analyze the pattern from the previous rounds:

1. **Routes and Payoffs:**
   - Route O-L-D has resulted in payoffs ranging from 10 to 100 points.
   - Route O-R-D has resulted in payoffs ranging from 30 to 150 points.
   
2. **Consistency and Variability:**
   - Route O-R-D has been chosen much more frequently by you, indicating a preference or favorable outcome in most cases.
   - Payoffs on route O-R-D vary widely, suggesting risk but potential high payoff when less crowded.

3. **Agent Distribution:**
   - Significant variations are observed in agents' distribution between O-L-D and O-R-D.
   - Route O-R-D generally has higher agent numbers, leading to lower payoffs when majority choose it.
   - Payoff was notably high on O-R-D when there were fewer agents (e.g., 4, 6, 8).

4. **Recent Choices' Outcomes:**
   - Payoff of 90 on route O-R-D in recent round (Round 37) with 10 agents suggests potential balance in agent distribution.
   - High payoffs in rounds where agent distribution between routes was balanced or slightly favorable.

5. **Strategic Decision:**
   - Going with route O-L-D may diversify your strategy and yield high payoff if fewer agents switch to it.
   - Historical data shows high payoffs on O-L-D in a few instances where distribution was more balanced or in favor of O-L-D.

Given these observations, choosing route O-L-D in the next round might yield a higher payoff if the recent pattern of distribution slightly shifts towards O-R-D, which can happen as you and other agents strategize based on previous movements.

Thus, the strategic choice for the next round is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide which route to choose for the next round, let's analyze the information provided from previous rounds:

1. **Observe the Patterns:**
   - The payoff structure shows higher payoffs when fewer agents choose the same route as you.
   - In some rounds where you had high payoffs (e.g., 110, 120, 130), fewer agents were on Route O-R-D when you chose it.

2. **Calculate Costs:**
   - Cost for Route O-L-D = 10 * (number of agents on O-L) + 210.
     - When 13 agents choose O-L, the cost is 10 * 13 + 210 = 340, giving a payoff of 60.
   - Cost for Route O-R-D = 210 + 10 * (number of agents on R-D).
     - When 5 agents choose R-D, the cost is 210 + 10 * 5 = 260, giving a payoff of 140.

3. **Choose Optimal Route:**
   - Route O-R-D tends to yield a higher payoff when fewer than half of the participants choose it. Round 24 shows a high payoff (150) when only 4 agents chose it.
   - The most balanced payoff distribution tends to happen when the participants are split evenly between the routes (around 9 agents on each).

4. **Decision Based on Trend:**
   - Given recent rounds, where more agents tend to choose O-R-D, it might be strategic to choose O-L-D if you anticipate a higher concentration on O-R-D.
   - In Round 38, you experienced fewer agents on O-R-D when you chose O-L-D, yielding a decent payoff.

**Decision:**
Considering the pattern, and to balance the risk and likelihood of a higher payoff based on recent agent distributions, choose the route that seems to be less preferred currently:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

This selection strategy is based on maximizing payoff by anticipating the movements of other agents and opting for the lesser-congested route. This historical information indicates a strategic tilt towards selecting Route O-L-D, expecting Route O-R-D to be more crowded in the next round.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a strategic choice for the next round, let's analyze the previous rounds' data and performance:

1. **Trends in Route Selection:**
   - There are fluctuations in the number of drivers choosing each route over the rounds.
   - At various points, one route becomes heavily congested while the other has fewer drivers.

2. **Analyzing Payoff and Corresponding Traffic:**
   - Higher payoffs are generally obtained when the chosen route has fewer drivers.
   - Example: In rounds where "O-R-D" was chosen and had fewer drivers, such as round 24 (4 drivers), the payoff was high (150).
   - Similarly, when "O-L-D" had fewer drivers, like in round 36 (9 drivers each) or round 39 (13 drivers on "O-L-D"), the payoff was higher.

3. **Optimal Route Balance:**
   - The optimal strategy seems to be choosing the route that is less congested.
   - The best payoffs have been around the balance point of 9 drivers each on both routes, suggesting that predicting shifts can be advantageous.

4. **Current Situation:**
   - In recent rounds, the distribution has been somewhat balanced, but there are still shifts:
     - Round 37: 10 on "O-R-D", 8 on "O-L-D" with high payoff on "O-R-D".
     - Round 38: 7 on "O-R-D", 11 on "O-L-D" with higher payoff when choosing "O-L-D".
     - Round 39: 5 on "O-R-D", 13 on "O-L-D", payoff was better on "O-L-D".

5. **Strategic Decision:**
   - Recent rounds show that "O-R-D" has consistently had fewer drivers than "O-L-D", suggesting it might become less congested soon.
   - Historically, alternating or predicting the shift based on the prior round's overcrowded route can yield better future payoffs.

**Conclusion:** To maximize potential payoff in the next round, the strategic decision would be to choose the route that had slightly fewer drivers recently, anticipating that others might switch due to congestion. This historical analysis suggests that for the next round, "O-R-D" might have fewer drivers if others switch to "O-L-D" after seeing higher allocation in recent rounds.
