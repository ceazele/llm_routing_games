System Message:

You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Round 1:
Human: The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision about which route to choose, consider the following steps:

1. **Understand the Costs:**

   - **Route O-L-D:** Cost = 10X + 210
     - X is the number of participants choosing this route.
   - **Route O-R-D:** Cost = 210 + 10Y
     - Y is the number of participants choosing this route.

2. **Initial Observation:**

   - Each route has a fixed cost of 210 for one segment, and a variable cost dependent on the number of participants for the other segment.

3. **Game Theory Consideration:**

   - If many participants choose the same route, the variable cost can be high.
   - Ideally, the aim is to minimize travel cost by anticipating other participants' choices.

4. **Strategy:**

   - Given 18 participants, potential imbalances can lead to significant cost differences.
   - If participants are equally divided, cost would be:
     - Each route being chosen by 9 participants:
       - O-L-D: 10 * 9 + 210 = 300
       - O-R-D: 210 + 10 * 9 = 300
     - Perfect balance gives the same total cost.

5. **Choosing a Route:**

   - If there's an indication others are choosing a route more frequently, choose the opposite.
   - Always monitor the previous rounds if information is available to make this determination.

6. **Expectation and Reaction:**

   - Expect participants to gravitate towards equilibrium where costs are equal.
   - React by occasionally choosing the less popular route to minimize costs when others overconverge on a route.

In the absence of past data and participant choices feedback, a probabilistic approach might be necessary until a pattern emerges.

Given that there's no prior data to indicate any particular trend, let's assume we're starting with a balanced approach until further rounds provide data:

Choose **Route: 'O-R-D'** to initially test the reaction and cost outcomes. 

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 2:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 80.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 7 agents
        O-R-D: 11 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide which route to choose in the upcoming round, let's analyze the situation based on the data from Round 1.

1. **Understand the Costs:**
   - Route O-L-D has a cost function of \(10X + 210\).
   - Route O-R-D has a cost function of \(210 + 10Y\). 

2. **Round 1 Costs Analysis:**
   - You chose O-R-D, sharing it with 11 agents.
   - The cost of O-R-D would be \(210 + 10 \times 11 = 320\).
   - Your payoff was \(400 - 320 = 80\).
   - On route O-L-D, 7 agents traveled, so the cost would have been \(10 \times 7 + 210 = 280\).
   - If you had chosen O-L-D, your payoff would have been \(400 - 280 = 120\).

3. **Decision Factors:**
   - The key to maximizing your payoff is choosing the route with the lowest expected number of agents, thereby minimizing the cost due to variable segments.
   - In Round 1, fewer agents chose route O-L-D, indicating a potentially lower cost for that round.

4. **Strategic Consideration:**
   - Given that 11 agents chose O-R-D in Round 1, it may be reasonable to expect them to reconsider their decisions if they also observed lower potential costs on route O-L-D.
   - However, predicting the exact number of individuals switching routes is challenging.
   - It's beneficial to assume that trends might continue unless disrupted by collective strategic shifts.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Choosing O-L-D seems advantageous if the trend of fewer agents on it continues.
   - To maximize expected payoff in the next round, it's a reasonable strategy to select route O-L-D, assuming others aim to minimize costs as well and might reconsider their high-cost experience.

Based on this analysis, the decision is to choose route O-L-D.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 3:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 80.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 7 agents
        O-R-D: 11 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 20.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 17 agents
        O-R-D: 1 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision about which route to choose for this round, let's analyze the information and outcomes from the previous two rounds.

**Round 1 Analysis:**
- I chose route O-R-D.
- Number of agents on route O-L-D: 7
- Number of agents on route O-R-D: 11
- My payoff was 80.

**Calculating the costs for Round 1:**
- For O-R-D: Cost = 210 (fixed for O-R) + 10 * 11 (for R-D) = 210 + 110 = 320
- Endowment = 400, so Payoff = 400 - 320 = 80 (which matches the given payoff)

**Round 2 Analysis:**
- I chose route O-L-D.
- Number of agents on route O-L-D: 17
- Number of agents on route O-R-D: 1
- My payoff was 20.

**Calculating the costs for Round 2:**
- For O-L-D: Cost = 10 * 17 (for O-L) + 210 (fixed for L-D) = 170 + 210 = 380
- Endowment = 400, so Payoff = 400 - 380 = 20 (which matches the given payoff)

**Considerations for Next Decision:**
1. **Payoff Comparison:** 
   - Round 1 (O-R-D) yielded a payoff of 80, while Round 2 (O-L-D) yielded a payoff of 20.
   - Higher payoff with route O-R-D in the first round.

2. **Agent Distribution:**
   - In Round 1, 11 agents chose O-R-D, which increased the cost.
   - In Round 2, only 1 agent chose O-R-D, which could imply it might be underused in the next round.

3. **Route Strategy:**
   - O-R-D has a fixed cost segment (O-R) which can be advantageous if fewer agents choose it, as seen in Round 2 where only 1 agent chose O-R-D.
   - The large number of agents on O-L-D in Round 2 shows it can become very costly with high usage.

**Decision:**
Given the lower number of agents on O-R-D in Round 2 and its potential for lower cost if few agents choose it, I will choose route O-R-D again. This decision is based on the presumption that other participants may switch back to O-L-D after the high cost they experienced last round.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Round 4:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 80.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 7 agents
        O-R-D: 11 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 20.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 17 agents
        O-R-D: 1 agents

Round 3:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 0 agents
        O-R-D: 18 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
Analyzing the previous rounds will help in making a more informed decision for the next one.

### Summary of Rounds:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Chose route: O-R-D
   - Payoff: 80
   - Distribution: 7 on O-L-D, 11 on O-R-D
   - Calculation: Travel cost = 400 - (210 + 10x11) = 320, hence Payoff = 400 - 320 = 80

2. **Round 2:**
   - Chose route: O-L-D
   - Payoff: 20
   - Distribution: 17 on O-L-D, 1 on O-R-D
   - Calculation: Travel cost = (10x17) + 210 = 380, hence Payoff = 400 - 380 = 20

3. **Round 3:**
   - Chose route: O-R-D
   - Payoff: 10
   - Distribution: 0 on O-L-D, 18 on O-R-D
   - Calculation: Travel cost = 210 + (10x18) = 390, hence Payoff = 400 - 390 = 10

### Observations:

- Choosing O-L-D is optimal only if it's less crowded, as each additional driver adds 10 to the cost.
- The O-R-D route has a fixed base cost of 210 regardless of other drivers choosing the first segment, but becomes costly when many drivers choose it due to the R-D segment's variable cost.
  
### Strategy for Next Round:

- **Current Trends**: Previously, O-L-D becomes too costly when over-selected, and O-R-D has been slightly preferable or equally balanced until many selected it in Round 3.
- **Potential Equilibrium**: Drivers may attempt to balance between the routes since both options become undesirable when over-selected.
  
Given these observations, it would be strategic to choose the less selected route or anticipate how others might react based on past experiences.

### Decision:

- It's likely that after a crowded O-R-D in Round 3, some drivers will switch back to O-L-D in the next round. 
- Choosing O-L-D might turn out to be cheaper, assuming a proportionate shift in driver choices.

Therefore, the strategic choice is:

{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Round 5:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 80.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 7 agents
        O-R-D: 11 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 20.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 17 agents
        O-R-D: 1 agents

Round 3:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 0 agents
        O-R-D: 18 agents

Round 4:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 30.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 16 agents
        O-R-D: 2 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide which route to choose, let's analyze the information from previous rounds and strategize accordingly.

1. **Understanding the Costs:**
   - Route O-L-D cost is `10 * X + 210`, where X is the number of participants on that route.
   - Route O-R-D cost is `210 + 10 * Y`, where Y is the number of participants on that route.

2. **Analyzing Previous Rounds:**
   - **Round 1:** Chose O-R-D, 11 agents were on the route, payoff was 80.
     - Cost on O-R-D = 400 - 80 = 320; 320 = 210 + 10 * 11.
   - **Round 2:** Chose O-L-D, 17 agents on the route, payoff was 20.
     - Cost on O-L-D = 400 - 20 = 380; 380 = 10 * 17 + 210.
   - **Round 3:** Chose O-R-D, 18 agents on the route, payoff was 10.
     - Cost on O-R-D = 400 - 10 = 390; 390 = 210 + 10 * 18.
   - **Round 4:** Chose O-L-D, 16 agents on the route, payoff was 30.
     - Cost on O-L-D = 400 - 30 = 370; 370 = 10 * 16 + 210.

3. **Observations:**
   - When many agents choose O-L-D, the cost increases significantly, as seen in rounds 2 and 4.
   - Fewer agents choose O-R-D, the cost is relatively stable but can be risky if everyone else chooses the same.
   - The highest payoff was in Round 1 when I chose O-R-D with a relatively moderate number of other agents.

4. **Strategy:**
   - With the previous rounds' data, choosing O-R-D seems more balanced when there are moderate participants, as extreme choices tend to sway heavily towards one route.
   - Given recent patterns, agents might switch routes in the next round. If many chose O-L-D in previous rounds, they might try O-R-D next.

5. **Decision:**
   - Given the tendency for agents to switch, but also a possibility that after heavy O-L-D usage they might continue with O-R-D, choose the route that historically balanced out better.

Thus, based on this analysis, the strategic choice for the next round would be to continue with the O-R-D route in the anticipation that others might still crowd O-L-D given the high numbers previously.

Round 6:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 80.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 7 agents
        O-R-D: 11 agents

Round 2:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 20.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 17 agents
        O-R-D: 1 agents

Round 3:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 0 agents
        O-R-D: 18 agents

Round 4:
- You chose route O-L-D and received a payoff of 30.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 16 agents
        O-R-D: 2 agents

Round 5:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 50.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 4 agents
        O-R-D: 14 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision on which route to choose, let's analyze the summary of the previous rounds in terms of costs and payoffs:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Chose O-R-D, 11 agents on O-R-D -> Cost: 210 + 10 * 11 = 320
   - Payoff: 400 - 320 = 80

2. **Round 2:**
   - Chose O-L-D, 17 agents on O-L-D -> Cost: 10 * 17 + 210 = 380
   - Payoff: 400 - 380 = 20

3. **Round 3:**
   - Chose O-R-D, 18 agents on O-R-D -> Cost: 210 + 10 * 18 = 390
   - Payoff: 400 - 390 = 10

4. **Round 4:**
   - Chose O-L-D, 16 agents on O-L-D -> Cost: 10 * 16 + 210 = 370
   - Payoff: 400 - 370 = 30

5. **Round 5:**
   - Chose O-R-D, 14 agents on O-R-D -> Cost: 210 + 10 * 14 = 350
   - Payoff: 400 - 350 = 50

### Observations:
- O-R-D tends to have fewer agents as compared to O-L-D, leading to slightly better payoffs.
- There is a fluctuation in the number of agents, indicating a lack of clear pattern in others' decision-making, except Round 3 where everyone chose O-R-D and yielded the worst payoff.
- When more people choose O-L-D, the cost rises significantly due to the variable component being affected more (10 * number of agents).

### Decision:
Given the recent history, choosing O-R-D might result in fewer agents on that route, as there isn’t a consistent turnout on O-L-D. O-R-D tends to have relatively fewer agents compared to extreme numbers occasionally seen on O-L-D. Therefore, choosing O-R-D might be a safer option for a potentially higher payoff given the unpredictable behavior of the agents.

Round 7:
Human: Summary of previous rounds:
Round 1:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 80.
- The number of agents on each route was:

        O-R-D: 2 agents

Round 5:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 50.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 4 agents
        O-R-D: 14 agents

Round 6:
- You chose route O-R-D and received a payoff of 120.
- The number of agents on each route was:
        O-L-D: 11 agents
        O-R-D: 7 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision on which route to choose in the next round, I will analyze the previous rounds' data and consider the pattern of the number of agents choosing each route and the resulting payoffs.

1. **Round Analysis:**
   - **Round 1:** Chose O-R-D, 11 agents, payoff = 80.
   - **Round 2:** Chose O-L-D, 17 agents, payoff = 20.
   - **Round 3:** Chose O-R-D, 18 agents, payoff = 10.
   - **Round 4:** Chose O-L-D, 16 agents, payoff = 30.
   - **Round 5:** Chose O-R-D, 14 agents, payoff = 50.
   - **Round 6:** Chose O-R-D, 7 agents, payoff = 120.
   
2. **Trends & Patterns:**
   - Higher number of agents on a route generally results in lower payoffs due to increased congestion costs.
   - When choosing O-R-D with fewer than 11 agents, payoffs were higher (see Round 1 and Round 6).
   - Selecting O-L-D when many agents chose that route resulted in low payoffs (Rounds 2 and 4).

3. **Current Insight:**
   - The last round had fewer people on O-R-D resulting in the highest payoff of 120.
   - O-L-D was chosen by 11 agents, potentially making it more congested and unattractive for the next choice.

4. **Decision Strategy:**
   - O-R-D seems to become less popular and therefore less congested, and historically low agent numbers on O-R-D (as in Round 6) yield higher payoffs.
   - There's a possibility that some agents will switch from O-L-D to O-R-D given the results of the last round, but the payoff pattern suggests it's still worth trying O-R-D when it's becoming less crowded.

Considering this analysis, I will choose route **O-R-D** for the next round. This decision balances the tendency for variation in agent movements while aiming to benefit from potentially lower congestion on O-R-D like seen in Round 6.

        O-R-D: 9 agents


The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision on which route to choose, let's analyze the data from previous rounds and consider the costs associated with each route.

1. **Route Cost Analysis**:
   - **Cost for Route O-L-D**: Varies based on the number of drivers (X) on segment O-L. The cost formula is \(10X + 210\).
   - **Cost for Route O-R-D**: Varies based on the number of drivers (Y) on segment R-D. The cost formula is \(210 + 10Y\).

2. **Review of Previous Rounds**:
   - When choosing **O-R-D** in rounds 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7, the payoffs were 80, 10, 50, 120, and 100 respectively.
     - Payoff correlates to lower congestion on segment R-D (fewer agents choosing O-R-D).
     - Highest payoff (120) occurred in round 6 when only 7 agents chose O-R-D.
   - When choosing **O-L-D** in rounds 2 and 4, the payoffs were 20 and 30 respectively.
     - Both rounds had high congestion on segment O-L (17 and 16 agents choosing O-L-D).

3. **Trends & Strategy**:
   - **O-L-D** tends to attract more drivers, which leads to higher costs and lower payoffs.
   - The best payoff for **O-R-D** was achieved when the number of drivers was lower on that route.

4. **Decision**:
   - Given that **O-R-D** can yield a higher payoff if fewer drivers choose it, and considering the trend of O-L-D having more drivers, it might be strategic to choose **O-R-D** again, hoping fewer drivers switch to it.

Now let's make the choice based on the above analysis:

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision on which route to choose for the next round, let's analyze the information provided from the previous rounds systematically. Our goal is to maximize our payoff, meaning we want to minimize the travel costs by selecting the route with fewer agents (optimally balancing or predicting other participants' choices).

Here's a summary of the performance for each route in terms of the number of agents and your payoff:

1. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Round 1: 11 agents, Payoff = 80
   - Round 3: 18 agents, Payoff = 10 (highest congestion)
   - Round 5: 14 agents, Payoff = 50
   - Round 6: 7 agents, Payoff = 120 (lowest congestion)
   - Round 7: 9 agents, Payoff = 100
   - Round 8: 13 agents, Payoff = 60

2. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Round 2: 17 agents, Payoff = 20
   - Round 4: 16 agents, Payoff = 30

Analyzing the number of agents and the corresponding payoffs from past rounds:
- Route O-R-D generally gave higher payoffs than O-L-D. Specifically, when fewer agents chose O-R-D, payoffs were higher (as seen in Round 6 with only 7 agents on O-R-D and payoff of 120).
- Route O-L-D has shown very high congestion (16+ agents in the rounds selected), associated with low payoffs.

Our observations:
- Congestion appears to switch between routes, with agents responding to congestion by switching routes, seeking a higher payoff, similar to our goal.
- Given the recorded patterns, when a route’s congestion significantly increases, agents seem to switch in subsequent rounds. In Round 8, O-L-D had fewer agents (5), thus those agents might migrate back to O-R-D if they felt they might achieve a lower cost there.

Strategic Decision:

Given the current pattern in Round 8 (only 5 on O-L-D), there is a chance that more participants might switch to O-L-D this round, making O-R-D potentially advantageous due to lesser congestion if not too many switch from O-R-D. Given past dynamics, O-R-D is generally chosen more often, thus it might be less congested this round because O-L-D had significantly fewer agents last time.

Taking these deductions into account, I will choose the route **O-R-D** in anticipation that it will have moderate congestion:

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To determine which route to choose in the next round, let's review the outcomes of the previous rounds and analyze the patterns in driver behavior and related payoffs.

1. **Observations from Previous Rounds:**
   - In rounds where I chose **O-R-D**: 
     - Payoffs were relatively higher when fewer drivers chose O-R-D and more chose O-L-D. For example, in round 6, 7 drivers including myself chose O-R-D, resulting in a 120 payoff when 11 drivers chose O-L-D.
     - Payoffs decreased as more drivers shifted to O-R-D. For instance, in round 3, all 18 drivers chose O-R-D resulting in a minimal payoff of 10.

   - In rounds where I chose **O-L-D**: 
     - The payoff was very low when almost all drivers, 17, chose O-L-D (e.g., round 2 with a payoff of 20).
     - A slightly higher payoff was obtained when there was a little more balance and fewer drivers on O-L-D (e.g. round 4 with 16 drivers on O-L-D resulting in a 30 payoff).

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The choice of route depends on both my choice and the collective decisions made by other drivers. 
   - A relatively lower number of drivers on my chosen route translates into lower costs for that route.
   - Shift in driver numbers between rounds often indicates other players reacting to high congestion in previous rounds.

3. **Decision Approach:**
   - Consider choosing the route with historical lower congestion if past rounds suggest other drivers might react by switching to the other route.
   - Look at the trend from the recent rounds to anticipate the possible behavior of other drivers.

4. **Current Situation:**
   - In the last round (round 9), only 5 drivers chose O-R-D, yielding a high payoff of 140, while more (13 drivers) chose O-L-D.
   - There's a potential that some drivers who experienced high congestion and costs on O-L-D in round 9 might now switch to O-R-D.

Given this analysis, choosing the **O-L-D** route may yield a more balanced distribution based on historical switching patterns. Thus, the likelihood of ending up in a less congested route with better payoff seems higher.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide on the optimal route for the next round, it's important to analyze the previous rounds carefully and make an educated guess about other agents' choices.

Here's a summary and analysis of past rounds:

1. **Performance Review:**
   - The highest payoff (140) was received when 13 agents chose route O-L-D and 5 chose route O-R-D. I chose O-R-D in this case.
   - The lowest payoff (10) was obtained when everyone (18 agents) chose route O-R-D.
   - The most frequently chosen route has been O-R-D, often resulting in a more congested and costly segment.

2. **Trend and Behavior:**
   - It seems that people are oscillating between routes based on previous outcomes. When a route becomes too congested, agents switch, leading to fluctuations in numbers.
   - There seems to have been significant congestion on O-L-D earlier, causing me to choose O-R-D for a relatively better payoff in later rounds.

3. **Strategic Consideration:**
   - Agents tend to react to congestion by switching to the less congested route. This means a user might switch back to O-L-D if O-R-D had high congestion in the previous round.
   - The payoff differences are heavily impacted by how many players choose each route.

4. **Expected Behavior in Round 11:**
   - Given that the last round saw an equal distribution, it's likely agents will disperse again. However, if some recalled that the higher payoff was in scenarios with more on O-L-D, they might lean toward it.

**Decision:**

Given the fluctuation trend and considering O-L-D might still be perceived as congested from past overuse, a guess would be beneficial to choose **O-R-D** under the assumption that not everyone will rush to switch back to O-L-D immediately after one balanced round.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide on the optimal route for the next round, we need to strategize based on the outcomes of previous rounds. 

1. **Analyze Past Payoffs**:
   - The highest payoff you received was 140 in Round 9, when 5 agents chose the route O-R-D, and 13 agents chose O-L-D.
   - You also received a decent payoff of 120 in Round 6 when 7 agents chose O-R-D, and 11 agents chose O-L-D.

2. **Patterns in Agent Distribution**:
   - It appears that when the majority of agents are on the O-L-D route, your payoff tends to be higher if you choose the O-R-D route.
   - Conversely, when more agents choose O-R-D, your payoff tends to be lower.

3. **Observations on Route Choice**:
   - Rounds where you chose O-R-D and fewer agents shared this route compared to O-L-D generally resulted in higher payoffs.
   - When the number of agents is equal or the majority choose O-R-D, your payoff tends to decrease.

4. **Aim for Maximum Payoff**:
   - To maximize payoff, it seems strategic to choose the route with fewer agents.
   - From past rounds, agents tend to alternate between routes, aiming to balance the numbers on each.

5. **Estimate Future Distribution**:
   - Based on recent rounds, where agents have been split more evenly or favored O-L-D, choosing O-R-D seems likely to be a safer bet for higher payoff as agents may shift to O-L-D again to balance.

Based on these analyses, the suggestion for the next round is to choose route **O-R-D**. This choice is based on the assumption that a higher number of agents may choose O-L-D, allowing for a potentially higher payoff on O-R-D.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide on the optimal route for the next round, we must consider the patterns and outcomes from the previous rounds. Let's analyze the information step by step.

1. **Understanding Costs and Payoffs**:
    - On route O-L-D, the travel cost is `10 * X + 210`.
    - On route O-R-D, the travel cost is `210 + 10 * Y`.
    - A higher number of participants on any segment increases the travel cost for that segment.

2. **Trend Analysis**:
    - Rounds where O-L-D was chosen:
      - Round 2: 17 agents on O-L-D; payoff of 20.
      - Round 4: 16 agents on O-L-D; payoff of 30.
      - Round 10: 9 agents on O-L-D; payoff of 100.
    - Rounds where O-R-D was chosen and payoff varied:
      - Round 1: 11 agents on O-R-D; payoff of 80.
      - Round 9: 5 agents on O-R-D; payoff of 140.
      - Round 12: 14 agents on O-R-D; payoff of 50.

3. **Evaluating Decisions**:
    - Higher costs and lower payoffs occur with more crowded routes.
    - Previously, when choosing the less crowded route, payoffs tend to be higher.
    - Rounds 6 and 9 demonstrate higher payoffs on O-R-D when fewer agents choose it.

4. **Pattern Recognition**:
    - There are few cases (Rounds 9 & 11) where the O-R-D route was less crowded and yielded high payoffs.
    - Round 12 shows a crowded O-R-D with low payoff.

5. **Choosing The Optimal Route**:
   - Based on recent trends, if fewer participants are expected on a route, choosing that route could lead to a higher payoff.
   - Given the unpredictability and variance of participants, and since O-R-D shows fluctuating but generally lower congestion and better payoffs recently, it might be beneficial to choose O-R-D when less congested.

In conclusion, the objective is to choose the route which would likely have fewer participants to minimize travel costs. Considering this, a calculated decision would be to select:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

This selection is made with the hope that the pattern observed holds, and fewer participants will further minimize costs on this round.

LLM Output:
To determine which route I should choose for the next round, it's important to analyze the outcomes and patterns of the previous rounds. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Analyze Past Trends**:
   - In rounds where I chose `O-R-D`, I generally received a decent payoff, especially when the number of agents was about evenly split between `O-L-D` and `O-R-D` or when `O-R-D` had fewer agents than `O-L-D`.
   - Higher payoffs were observed when choosing `O-R-D` and the distribution was balanced or favored `O-L-D` in terms of number of drivers.

2. **Comparison**:
   - When choosing `O-L-D`, the payoffs generally tended to be lower unless the number of agents choosing that route was exceptionally low compared to those choosing `O-R-D`.
   - The best payoff observed with `O-R-D` was 140 when the route was chosen by fewer agents than those who chose `O-L-D`.

3. **Identify Patterns**:
   - `O-R-D` tends to be more favorable when fewer agents choose it compared to `O-L-D` or when traffic is balanced.
   - Since the recent rounds have generally shown a trend towards a balanced split or preference for `O-R-D`, predicting future behavior is about recognizing patterns: shifts towards balance have yielded optimal results.

4. **Prediction for Next Round**:
   - Given the variability and payoff trends, identifying that a likely scenario may involve an equal split or slightly more drivers on `O-R-D`, it may be advantageous to choose `O-L-D` if expecting others to switch back to `O-R-D`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on recent patterns, I'm inclined to choose route `O-L-D` because it is possible that many will continue switching to `O-R-D` assuming others will do the same due to its higher historical payoffs.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a strategic decision for the next round, let's analyze the past rounds:

1. **Cost Calculation for Each Segment**:
   - For O-L-D route, the cost is `10 * X + 210`.
   - For O-R-D route, the cost is `210 + 10 * Y`.

2. **Identify Trends**:
   - Historically, your payoffs have varied based on the congestion of each route.
   - When route O-R-D had fewer drivers, the payoff was higher.
   - Similarly, route O-L-D also yielded higher payoffs with fewer drivers.

3. **Recent Patterns**:
   - The last few rounds show an approximately even distribution of drivers between the two routes. For instance, in rounds 7, 10, and 13, drivers were evenly split and payoffs were equal when choosing either route.
   - Round 12 saw a notably higher number of drivers on O-R-D, which resulted in a lower payoff.

4. **Effective Strategy**:
   - Choosing the less congested route generally yields higher payoffs.
   - If there seems to be an equal split of drivers, the choice of route doesn't impact the payoff significantly.
   - When a route is becoming more crowded over successive rounds, it might be beneficial to switch to the less popular route.

5. **Optimal Choice for Next Round**:
   - Given the unpredictability and equal split in previous rounds, consider the tendency for drivers to potentially shift routes based on the last outcomes.
   - Since recent rounds showed balanced distribution, it's challenging to predict a clear trend change.
   - Thus, opting for diversification or switching might prove advantageous if the trend changes again.

Based on this analysis, and in an effort to maximize payoff by capturing any trend shifts, a prudent decision would be to choose the route "O-R-D" assuming others could switch back to O-L-D due to even splits witnessed in recent rounds.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a more strategic decision in selecting a route for the next round, let’s analyze the data from previous rounds to identify patterns and optimal choices:

1. **Analyzing Patterns:**
   - When you chose **O-R-D**, you generally had good payoffs (e.g., 80 in Round 1, 120 in Round 6, 100 in Round 7, 110 in Round 11).
   - When you chose **O-L-D**, the payoff varied significantly (e.g., 20 in Round 2, 100 in Round 10 and 14).

2. **Distribution of Agents:**
   - High congestion on **O-R-D** was seen in Round 3 with 18 agents, leading to a low payoff.
   - **O-L-D** peaks in Round 2 with 17 agents also led to a low payoff.

3. **Balanced Rounds:**
   - Rounds with equal distribution (i.e., 9 agents on each route) provided moderate payoffs on either route.

4. **Recency and Trend:**
   - In recent rounds like 13 and 14, choosing either route when agents are equally split resulted in a payoff of 100.
   - Recent tendency also shows some clustering back to **O-R-D** or oscillation between routes for balance.

5. **Current Best Strategy:**
   - To maximize your payoff, aim for a route that is less congested.
   - Based on these patterns, trying to predict where fewer agents will go might result in a better payoff. In rounds where **9-9 splits** occur, you're less likely to be penalized heavily.

Given we see a back and forth in congestion between the two routes, let’s predict that drivers may now overcompensate on **O-L-D** based on the payoff trend favoring **O-R-D**.

**Decision:**
- This round may see a slight drop in agents choosing **O-R-D** following the patterning back to more **O-L-D** choice.
  
Therefore, select route **O-L-D** with the anticipation that recent strategy fluctuations might push others to choose O-R-D, leaving O-L-D less congested.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make the decision for the next route, it's important to analyze the trends and outcomes from the previous rounds. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Assess My Payoffs:**
   - My highest payoffs occurred when I chose route O-R-D in rounds 6 (120), 9 (140), and 11 (110).
   - Moderate payoffs were noticed in O-L-D in rounds 10 and 14 (both 100), and relatively lower payoffs were seen when I chose routes heavily trafficked (e.g., Round 3 and 2 with payoffs of 10 and 20).

2. **Traffic Patterns:**
   - Route O-R-D tends to have fluctuating numbers, sometimes high and sometimes balanced.
   - Route O-L-D had significantly more agents in rounds 2 and 4 but tended to balance out in later rounds.

3. **Balanced Rounds:**
   - Whenever both routes had an equal number of agents (9 agents each), I received a decent payoff from both (Round 10, 13, and 14). This suggests equilibrium can be beneficial if I end up on one of those routes.

4. **Observations:**
   - Switching between routes tends to correlate with obtaining good payoffs when fewer people predicted the same switch.
   - The last round saw O-L-D being more popular, so it's likely more participants may switch back or a similar distribution might occur.

5. **Deciding the Next Route:**
   - Based on the analysis, choosing route O-R-D seems promising due to its past advantage when it had fewer members than O-L-D or when both routes balanced out. This route often resulted in high payoffs in recent rounds of lower O-R-D traffic.

Given this analysis, the strategy leans toward choosing O-R-D. This balances potential low competition and stable past performances.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide the route for the next round based on past data, let's analyze the previous rounds:

1. **Payoff Analysis**:
   - High payoffs were generally achieved when the number of agents on the chosen route was smaller.
   - Specifically, rounds 2, 4, 6, 9, 11, and 16 show a trend where choosing the route with fewer participants led to better payoffs.

2. **Route Balancing**:
   - There are fluctuations in the number of participants choosing each route.
   - Alternating between routes sometimes seems to be a strategy to try and predict which route will have fewer participants.

3. **Round Patterns**:
   - Participants reacting and switching between O-L-D and O-R-D aims to balance the number of agents, leading to payoffs averaging around 100 or more when routes are balanced.

4. **Current Trend**:
   - In the latest round (Round 17), more agents have chosen O-R-D (13) compared to O-L-D (5).
   - Historically, when the number of agents on a route becomes high in one round, the tendency might be for some to switch in the next round to the less crowded route.

5. **Decision Making**:
   - If the pattern holds, participants may switch to the less crowded route next round.
   - Given the data from Round 17, a reasonable decision could be to choose route **O-L-D** assuming others might switch to balance the load, leading to potentially fewer participants on O-L-D next round.

From the analysis, I will choose **route O-L-D** for the next round, aiming to benefit from potentially fewer participants switching to O-L-D.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision about which route to choose in the next round, let's analyze the patterns and outcomes from the previous rounds.

1. **Payoffs Analysis:**
   - The goal is to maximize the payoff, which is 400 minus the total cost.
   - Higher payoffs are typically obtained when fewer drivers choose the same route, indicating lower congestion costs.

2. **Observation of Patterns:**
   - The payoffs vary significantly depending on the load on each route.
   - When "O-R-D" was chosen:
     - Payoffs ranged from 10 to 140 points.
     - Higher payoffs (110, 140) occur when fewer drivers, such as 5-8 agents, chose the same route.
   - When "O-L-D" was chosen:
     - Payoffs ranged from 20 to 100 points.
     - Higher payoffs (100 points) were achieved when the number of agents on this route was balanced with the "O-R-D" route (e.g., 9 agents on each).

3. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - To maximize payoff, choose the route with potentially fewer competitors.
   - Recent rounds have shown some balance between routes, where choosing a less crowded route has resulted in better payoffs.
   - High costs occur when the chosen route becomes too crowded or if the driver balance is disrupted.

4. **Optimal Strategy Moving Forward:**
   - Based on recent rounds, when the selections were nearly balanced (equal), the payoff seemed more predictable and favorable.
   - It may be advantageous to choose "O-R-D" for this round due to several rounds where it yielded higher payoffs with a moderate number of agents.

5. **Adaptive Decision:**
   - Given the fluctuating patterns between rounds and the recent information, let's consider the possibility of other drivers switching strategies.
   - "O-R-D" might currently offer a balance, considering previous rounds yielded higher payoffs when fewer drivers chose it compared to "O-L-D."

Therefore, the chosen route for the next round would be "O-R-D".

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision on which route to choose in the next round, let's analyze the previous rounds.

1. **Understanding Patterns:**
   - When a route is chosen by more drivers, the cost of that route increases due to the variable cost multiplier (10 * X or 10 * Y).
   - Conversely, if a route has fewer drivers, the cost decreases, yielding a higher payoff.

2. **Review of Previous Rounds:**
   - The best outcomes were observed when the route I chose had a relatively balanced number of agents or fewer drivers, leading to higher payoffs.
   - Significant payoffs were received in rounds such as Round 6, Round 9, and Round 11 where the distribution was more favorable.

3. **Observations:**
   - When I chose O-R-D and fewer agents used it, my payoff was higher (example: Round 9 with a payoff of 140).
   - In instances where O-L-D was less crowded, payoffs were similarly favorable (example: Round 10 with a payoff of 100).

4. **Strategic Decision:**
   - The aim is to anticipate the choice of other drivers and go for the route that tends to have a balanced or fewer number of agents.
   - Reviewing the immediate past rounds, the general trend seems alternating between O-R-D dominance (like in Round 19) and a relatively balanced distribution.

5. **Prediction for Next Round:**
   - Based on recent rounds, if a pattern of alternation continues, there might be a shift in driver preference to O-L-D after O-R-D had a higher count recently in Round 19.
   - However, past trends also indicate anytime most drivers shifted to one route, the subsequent rounds presented opportunities for the other route to have fewer drivers.

Taking all these observations into account, I will choose:

- **Route:** O-L-D

This decision is based on anticipating a shift and leveraging the fluctuation between routes to optimize for less congestion.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To determine the optimal route for the upcoming round, let's analyze the pattern and outcomes from the previous rounds:

1. **Analyze Payoffs and Agent Distribution:**
   - High payoffs (usually >100) occur when choosing the route that has around 8 or fewer agents.
   - Payoffs tend to be higher when the choice aligns with fewer agents on a segment, reducing the variable travel cost (10 * X or 10 * Y).

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - Routinely, choosing a route when it had 5 to 9 agents provided relatively balanced payoffs, ranging from 80 to 140.
   - High congestion typically correlates with lower payoffs.

3. **Recent Rounds Insight:**
   - The last few rounds show that switching between routes occasionally yields less predictable results, indicating both routes have been used equally.
   - Notably, route O-R-D recently had alternating payoffs, depending on the balance in the agents' division.

4. **Risk Evaluation:**
   - Choosing O-L-D in a heavily dominated round led to low payoffs, while a balanced agent distribution between O-L-D and O-R-D generally led to better results.

5. **Decision Making:**
   - Based on past results, if the participant expects a balanced agent distribution (e.g., 8-10 agents per route), both routes can be viable. Otherwise, choosing less congested routes tends to yield better payoffs.

**Conclusion:**
Given the pattern observed, the decision should be made to select a route that historically provides balanced distribution and optimal payoff when not overly congested.

For this upcoming decision based on identified patterns and strategies:
- Considering trends and previous decisions, opt for the route that hasn't been overly congested in prior rounds, or switch to balance expectations against the likely trend.

Let's choose:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

This choice is based on the balanced payoff rounds with a moderate number of participants favoring O-R-D, anticipating that others may balance out or switch routes based on recent high congestion in certain rounds.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide on a route for the next round, let's analyze the past rounds based on patterns and trends observed, with a focus on maximizing the payoff.

### Observations:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - High costs result from a high number of drivers choosing this route. For instance, in rounds where 16 or 17 drivers chose O-L-D, the payoffs were very low (20 to 30).
   - When the number of drivers on O-L-D is around 9, the payoff achieved is 100. This indicates a good trade-off between cost and the number of agents.

2. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Payoffs improve significantly when the number of drivers choosing O-R-D is relatively low (around 5 to 8 drivers), resulting in payoffs ranging from 100 to 140.
   - Similar to O-L-D, the payoffs drop significantly as the number of drivers increases on O-R-D.

### Pattern Analysis:
- **Balanced Distribution:** When both routes have about 9 drivers, the payoff is roughly equal on both routes (around 100). 
- **Recent Rounds Trend:** There has been a slight preference for O-R-D among the other drivers, which has sometimes pushed the number of drivers on this route to higher levels, reducing the payoff.

### Strategy for Next Round:
To maximize the payoff, it is prudent to choose a route that has historically demonstrated a better payoff with fewer drivers. Given that O-R-D historically offers higher payoffs with fewer drivers and the recent rounds showing a trend where not too many drivers opt for O-L-D, route O-L-D may offer better potential in the upcoming round if the trend holds and other drivers switch to O-R-D after recent rounds.

Considering the above observations, I'll choose:

**Route: O-L-D**

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision on which route to choose in the next round, let's first analyze the outcomes of the previous rounds:

1. **Payoff Analysis:** We need to look at the payoffs for each choice in the prior rounds. Generally, a higher payoff indicates less congestion on the chosen route.

2. **Route O-L-D:** Let's observe that the highest payoff achieved on this route was 120 (Round 22) when 7 agents chose it. Other notable payoffs were 100 (Round 10 and 14) when 9 agents selected this route. However, selecting this route led to a low payoff (20) when 17 agents were on it (Round 2).

3. **Route O-R-D:** On route O-R-D, the highest payoff was also 120 (Round 6), when 7 agents chose it. Notably, this route frequently resulted in payoffs above 80 when fewer than 11 agents selected it, occasionally yielding better outcomes than heavily congested alternatives.

4. **Congestion Patterns:** We can note some patterns in agent distribution:
   - When both routes have about 9 agents (Round 7, 10, 13, 14), payoffs are generally balanced.
   - When a route has significantly more agents (11 or more), the other tends to offer higher payoffs for those who deviate.

5. **Strategic Decision Making:** A viable strategy is to anticipate others' choices and choose the less congested route. Given that O-R-D and O-L-D each offer high payoffs when chosen by 7-9 agents, observing recent trends in congestion is crucial.

6. **Recent Preference Trends:** In the last few rounds (20-22), it seems O-R-D tends to draw more agents whereas O-L-D had less competition (7 agents in Round 22), leading to higher payoffs.

**Decision:** Considering agents’ tendencies and my historical payoffs, choosing **O-L-D** might offer a better payoff if the pattern from Round 22 persists. However, risk due to fluctuating agent distribution still exists.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide on the route selection, we can perform a strategic analysis based on the prior rounds. The objective is to maximize the payoff by choosing the route with a lower congestion, thereby minimizing the cost incurred.

1. **Payoff Analysis**: 
   - Payoff is calculated as endowment (400) minus travel cost. The travel costs for each route are:
     - **O-L-D**: 10X + 210
     - **O-R-D**: 210 + 10Y
   - The aim is to minimize these costs by choosing a less congested route.
  
2. **Route Behavior**:
   - Check patterns observed from the previous rounds:
     - High payoffs generally occurred when the selected route had fewer participants.
     - Payoffs close to 0 occurred when the chosen route was heavily congested (e.g., rounds 2, 3, 4, and 19).
     - Optimal results are achieved when there is a balance between the numbers of participants on each route, historically around 8 to 9 participants per route, as seen in rounds 10, 13, 14 (payoff of 100).

3. **Current Insight**:
   - Over the last few rounds, there is a frequent fluctuation in the number of agents choosing each route.
   - In the last round (23), more drivers chose O-L-D than O-R-D, resulting in a better result for those on O-R-D despite choosing O-L-D myself. It might be that the trend will inverse in this round.

4. **Decision Strategy**:
   - There is a recent pattern where people shifted to O-L-D (13 agents vs 5 agents in O-R-D in certain rounds like 20). While I was on O-L-D before, the trend may suggest that others might swap away from O-L-D soon.

5. **Predicting Opponent Behavior**:
   - Based on previous behaviors, it may be advantageous to exploit the fluctuation by predicting a shift back to O-R-D.

Ultimately, based on these observations, **choosing route O-R-D** appears strategic. This decision intends to exploit the possible reaction of participants shifting back to balance the previously seen congestion in O-L-D. This choice considers the potential for maximizing payoff by anticipating changes in participant distribution.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision on which route to choose, let's analyze the previous rounds to discern any patterns or strategies that have led to higher payoffs.

1. **Understanding the Cost Structure:**
   - Route O-L-D: Cost = \(10X + 210\) where \(X\) is the number of drivers on segment O-L.
   - Route O-R-D: Cost = \(210 + 10Y\) where \(Y\) is the number of drivers on segment R-D.

2. **Payoff Calculation:**
   - Payoff = Endowment (400) - Cost

3. **Observing Patterns:**
   - High payoffs are generally achieved when fewer drivers choose the same route as you.
   - Rounds where you achieved a payoff of 120 or 140 (Rounds 6, 9, and 22) had fewer agents on the chosen route, suggesting choosing a less popular route is beneficial.

4. **Route Dynamics:**
   - When you chose route O-R-D, the average payoff was higher when the agents choosing this route were close to or less than 8.
   - For route O-L-D, higher payoffs occurred when the number of agents on this route was between 7 and 10.

5. **Strategy to Consider:**
   - If the number of agents on a route is low, the cost attributed to the flexible segment is minimized, hence maximizing payoff.
   - Alternating choices to avoid patterns that others may predict.
   - Given the fluctuating high number on route O-R-D in some rounds, choosing route O-L-D when it seems less crowded might be beneficial.

6. **Predictive Choice Based on History:**
   - Recent trends show fluctuations but trying the less obvious choice has often provided better payoffs.

Considering these observations, and given the most current rounds where Route O-R-D often congests, I propose choosing 'O-L-D' in anticipation that it might turn out to be less crowded this round.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision about which route to choose in the upcoming round, let's analyze the patterns and results from the previous rounds.

### Observations:
1. **Route O-L-D**:
   - Tends to have a high payoff when fewer agents choose it. For instance, rounds with 7-9 agents choosing O-L-D often resulted in a higher payoff (such as round 22 with a payoff of 120).
   - When many agents (13-17) choose O-L-D, the payoff is substantially lower (payoffs as low as 20).

2. **Route O-R-D**:
   - Similarly, O-R-D yields a better payoff when the number of agents is on the lower side. For example, rounds with 5-8 agents choosing this route often resulted in higher payoffs.
   - High agent-count rounds typically lead to lower payoffs.

### Best Strategy:
- Considering the patterns, maximizing payoff seems to work when choosing the route with fewer predicted agents.
- Historically, when the number of agents is balanced between the two routes (e.g., 9-9 split), the payoff remains moderate.

### Decision Making:
- In the latest rounds, both routes seem to fluctuate in terms of how many agents choose them. It's a likely scenario that after observed larger groups on O-L-D in recent rounds, some may opt to switch back.
- The most recent successful rounds where I got a higher payoff occurred when there were around 6-8 agents on O-R-D or around 7-9 agents on O-L-D.

Thus, considering both the patterns and possible strategy adjustments of others based on these observations, I'll choose route **O-R-D** for the next round, anticipating potential reduction in agents selecting this route after a couple of high count rounds on O-R-D.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
Based on the summaries from the previous 26 rounds, let's analyze the past choices and outcomes to make an informed decision for the next round.

### Observations:

1. **Balance Between Routes:**
   - The number of agents on each route varied significantly over the rounds. No consistent pattern emerged where one route was always less crowded than the other.

2. **Payoffs Analysis:**
   - Higher payoffs generally occurred when the chosen route had fewer participants.
   - Rounds with balanced distribution (9 on each route) often yielded moderate payoffs.

3. **Route Preferences:**
   - O-L-D gave a very high payoff when fewer agents (6-7) chose this route.
   - O-R-D payoffs improved noticeably when it had fewer agents than O-L-D.

4. **Recent Trends:**
   - In the latest rounds (23-26), the payoffs for O-L-D were generally good except when the number went above 15.
   - O-R-D has increasingly seen more participants, which lowered payoffs compared to earlier rounds where fewer agents traveled on it.

### Decision Strategy:
- The goal is to strike a balance between the number of participants choosing each route.
- It seems advantageous to choose the route that recently had fewer participants if the trend persists.
- Consideration of previous rounds tends to show better outcomes when aligning choices with the less congested route as observed in very recent rounds (22-26).

### Suggested Route Choice:
- Since Round 26 saw 12 agents on O-R-D and 6 on O-L-D, and with the recent alternate route choice pattern, choosing O-L-D, which had fewer participants, is likely to maintain lower costs if this trend continues.

Therefore, based on the current analysis, it might be strategic to choose:

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide on which route to choose for the next round, let's analyze the previous rounds' data and look for patterns or trends:

1. **Payoff Analysis**: 
   - The payoffs generally range from 10 to 140, with better payoffs generally occurring when there is a more balanced distribution or when the chosen route has fewer agents.

2. **Number of Agents**:
   - **Route O-L-D** tends to have fewer agents overall in some cases but fluctuates. When it had significantly fewer agents, it resulted in higher payoffs (e.g., Round 9 and Round 22).
   - **Route O-R-D** also has similar fluctuation patterns, and a higher number of agents on this route tends to result in lower payoffs (e.g., Rounds 3 and 12).

3. **Observed Patterns**:
   - Balanced distribution (9-9 split) consistently yields a middle-of-the-road payoff of 100 points.
   - Whenever O-L-D has an equal number or fewer agents compared to O-R-D, the payoff is better or equivalent (e.g., Rounds 9, 22, 23, 27).

4. **Recent Trends**: 
   - There appears to be a tendency for participants to switch between routes, possibly in response to observed payoffs. For instance, there was a switch after high payoff rounds.

5. **Strategy Moving Forward**:
   - Considering the alternating pattern, and after a high payoff round on O-L-D (Round 27, 100 point payoff), participants may be inclined to switch back to O-R-D.
   - By choosing O-L-D, there’s a potential for fewer agents on that route, leading to a reduced cost and higher payoff.

With these observations, a reasonable decision is to choose the route that has the potential to have fewer agents:

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision regarding whether to choose route O-L-D or O-R-D in the next round, let's analyze the patterns from previous rounds and determine which route might offer the better payoff:

### Analysis of Payoffs:

1. When O-L-D had fewer participants (6-7), it significantly improved the payoff (Rounds 22, 28).
2. When O-R-D had extreme participants (close to 18), the payoff was poor (Round 3).
3. Payoffs when both routes have an equal number (9 each) tend to be moderate but safe (Rounds 10, 13, 14, 27).
4. More participants on route O-R-D generally resulted in lower payoffs, except where participants were split more evenly or where O-L-D had a much higher count.
5. After considering a mix of opponents' strategies where oscillations between routes could occur, recently we observe better opportunities on O-L-D despite alternating picks.

### Recent Tendencies:
- O-L-D when chosen with fewer participants maximizes payoffs, especially when O-R-D is crowded (Rounds 16, 20, 22, 28).

### Decision Strategy:
- Participants appear to have alternated between routes leading to scattered outcomes at times.
- Trends show tendencies swing around optimal split, so monitoring shifts in participant selection has led to strategic choices being made effectively with O-L-D showed better results when a moderate group selected it, given recent results leaning more toward O-R-D slightly crowded again.

### Conclusion:
Choosing O-L-D for the next round appears optimal, because: 
1. Payoffs were higher when the route was chosen by fewer participants.
2. Current selection shifts and history demonstrated stronger results under potential leaning shifts.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision about the next route choice, let's examine the patterns observed in the previous rounds:

1. **Endowment and Cost Structure:**
   - Each round, you start with an endowment of 400 points.
   - Costs for routes are affected by the number of agents:
     - Route O-L-D: Cost = 10X + 210
     - Route O-R-D: Cost = 210 + 10Y
     - Payoff = Endowment - Cost

2. **Historical Payoffs and Agent Distribution:**
   - Your payoffs tend to be higher when fewer agents choose the same route. For instance, significant payoffs were received when the route chosen had a balanced or lower number of participants.
   - Lower payoffs occur when the chosen route is overcrowded with participants.
   
3. **Patterns Observed:**
   - When you and most participants picked O-R-D, the payoff often dropped (e.g., Rounds 3 and 19).
   - Good payoffs were noted when you chose a route with around half the number of participants or fewer (e.g., Rounds 9, 22, 27).

4. **Consideration for Next Decision:**
   - Given the alternating pattern and that we have just completed Round 29, where O-L-D was chosen by many, there's a likelihood that participants may switch.
   - Participants might choose more balanced routes to maximize their scores.

5. **Risk Balancing:**
   - Choosing a route with a current lower number of participants (historically) is advantageous.
   - More people tend to cluster on a route thinking it's less crowded based on recent past rounds.

**Conclusion and Decision:**

- Based on data, participants may be more inclined to adjust for balance in response to previous overcrowding.
- It would be strategic to choose the route that has shown lower or balanced participation in previous patterns such as 'O-R-D', particularly if a larger group is anticipated to switch to 'O-L-D' following Round 29’s crowd.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision for the next round, let’s analyze the information from previous rounds and determine the best route choice:

1. **Identifying Trends**:
   - Starting from Round 1 to Round 30, both routes have been chosen frequently. The O-R-D route appears to be slightly more crowded in general compared to O-L-D, leading to lower payoffs in some cases.
   - Payoffs seem to be generally higher when the selected route is less crowded. This implies that choosing a route opposite to the current trend might yield a better payoff.

2. **Recent Trends**:
   - In the last few rounds (e.g., Rounds 27-30), we observe a mix but with recent inclinations towards O-R-D and higher payoffs when choosing based on alternating crowd dynamics.
   - In Rounds 28 and 30, both when choosing O-L-D and O-R-D, an approximate balance (6 vs. 12; 7 vs. 11, respectively) was observed, yielding decent payoffs.

3. **Balancing Choice**:
   - You tend to receive higher payoffs when the number of drivers on chosen minority route is lower, leading us to consider behavioral patterns of others.
   - A choice sometimes leans toward the less popular option immediately after noting previous rounds' distributions can strategically maximize payoff if others follow a pattern.

4. **Predicting Route Occupancy**:
   - From history, a balanced split frequently occurs, especially around the middle to latter rounds. 
   - Expect a possible shift or strategic play by participants who also recognize trends, thus changing normal crowd patterns on each route periodically.

5. **Strategy Suggestion**:
   - Given the alternating trend near rounds 28-30 and the fact that O-L-D was chosen in the last round (Round 30), a shift towards O-R-D with fewer participants could provide a higher payoff if others move to rebalance.
   - Predict that some participants might switch to O-L-D thinking it's less crowded after the recent O-R-D.

Based on this strategic analysis, the next choice aiming to maximize payoff with the pattern observed would be the opposite of typical paths to balance, but considering prior periods' potential shifts:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Choosing "O-R-D" could potentially yield better results if the anticipated shift in participant distribution occurs in the upcoming round.

   - Endowment = 400 points; Payoff = Endowment - Travel cost.

2. **Outcomes and Patterns:**
   - High payoffs (e.g., 120 in Rounds 6 and 31, 130 in Round 28, and 140 in Round 9) were achieved when fewer participants were on the chosen route.
   - The payoffs have a tendency to be more balanced (around 100) when the agents are equally split between the routes (e.g., Rounds 7, 10, 13, and 27).

3. **Agent Distribution Trends:**
   - There have been instances where one route is heavily favored over the other and this has affected overall payoffs significantly.
   - Recent rounds (e.g., Round 30) show 11 agents on O-R-D, whereas good payoffs on O-L-D arise with lower agent counts (observed around 7 agents on O-L-D).

4. **Strategy Consideration:**
   - If the goal is to maximize payoff, it is beneficial to choose the route that is expected to be selected by fewer agents. Historically this has shifted between the two routes depending on patterns a few rounds before.

5. **Recent Trends:**
   - Rounds 28-31 show a balance in payoffs between both routes, hinting at a potential for agent distribution fluctuation.
   - The strategy could be to go to the less popular route last round given historical tendencies for agents to switch if a route was crowded.

### Decision for Next Round:
Considering the observed patterns and recent fluctuations, it would be optimal to select the route expected to have fewer participants this round.

Given that Round 31 had:
- O-L-D with 11 agents
- O-R-D with 7 agents

Historically, after rounds with these numbers, agents might try to switch to O-L-D seeing that O-R-D had a favorable payoff distribution previously. This pattern suggests that **choosing 'O-R-D'** would likely result in facing a smaller number of participants and maximize potential payoff.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision on the optimal route for the next round, let's analyze the data from previous rounds:

1. **Payoff Assessment**: We aim to maximize the payoff or minimize the travel cost. 
    - The payoff is calculated by subtracting the travel cost from an endowment of 400 points.
    - The travel costs are based on both fixed and variable components depending on the route and the number of drivers on each segment.

2. **Route Cost Calculation**:
   - For Route `O-L-D`: Cost is \(10X + 210\).
   - For Route `O-R-D`: Cost is \(210 + 10Y\).

3. **Trends and Observations**:
   - High payoffs are typically associated with fewer drivers on the chosen route.
   - For `O-R-D`, better payoffs occurred when fewer drivers chose `O-R-D`. 
   - For `O-L-D`, better payoffs occurred when fewer drivers chose `O-L-D`.

4. **Recent Rounds Analysis**:
   - In Round 31, choosing `O-R-D` with 7 drivers resulted in a high payoff of 120.
   - In Round 32, choosing `O-R-D` with 10 drivers provided a payoff of 90, which is also relatively high.
   - Several rounds showed low payoffs when `O-L-D` had a high number of drivers (close to or exceeding 13).

5. **Strategic Choice**:
   - Based on the recent pattern of driver distribution and payoff, it seems safer to choose the route expected to have fewer drivers.
   - Recent rounds suggest that `O-R-D` has managed to yield decent payoffs with a moderate number of drivers.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the recent trends and the goal of maximizing payoff, choosing `O-R-D` appears to strategically align with historical payoffs received when fewer drivers choose `O-R-D`, especially when the driver count is balanced or favors `O-R-D` by a small margin.

Hence, for the next round, the chosen route is:

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an informed decision for the next round, let's analyze the data from the previous rounds. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Payoffs and Route Choices**: 
   - The payoff is higher when fewer people choose the same route as you. The costs on segments O-L and R-D increase with the number of drivers on them.
   - Payoffs have been favorable when there is a balanced or lower number of competitors on your chosen route. For example, routes with 7 or 8 other drivers have resulted in higher scores, such as 120 points.

2. **Historical Patterns**:
   - There seems to be a fluctuation in the number of drivers on each route. Sometimes, the majority switch to O-L-D and other times to O-R-D.
   - You scored 120 points in Rounds 6 and 31 with 7 and 7 drivers on O-R-D, indicating it can be a beneficial choice under some conditions.

3. **Recent Trends**:
   - Recent rounds (29-33) see a mix between O-L-D and O-R-D. The last round, you chose O-R-D and received a 100 payoff with an equal split of drivers (9-9).
   - The previous tendency is that players often shift to the route with fewer drivers after a round of imbalance, i.e., if one side gets crowded, the next round that side might see fewer drivers.

4. **Strategy Consideration**:
   - We should aim to be on the less crowded route. However, predicting the fluctuation could be tricky.
   - Based on the trend, if many chose O-R-D recently, there could be a shift back to O-L-D.
   - It's also reasonable to consider the distribution being somewhat balanced due to continuous rounds, aiming to exploit moments where the crowd shifts significantly to one option.

Given these considerations, a reasonable choice could be to go for the route O-L-D, anticipating shifts from competitors trying to balance out from O-R-D. This provides a chance for a higher payoff if fewer competitors are on O-L-D for the next round.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make an optimal decision, let's analyze the data from the previous rounds and identify patterns in route selections and payoffs:

1. **Patterns in Route Selection and Payoffs:**
   - When you and fewer agents chose route O-L-D, your payoff tended to be higher. For example, in Round 34, with 9 agents on each route, you received a payoff of 100.
   - Similarly for route O-R-D, fewer agents on the same route resulted in higher payoffs. For instance, in Round 31, with 7 agents on O-R-D, the payoff was 120.
   - In rounds where most participants picked one route, payoffs for the minority group were higher. This is evident in rounds where each route had close-to-equal distribution (e.g., Rounds 7, 13, 33).

2. **Estimate the Number of Agents likely to Choose each Route:**
   - Rounds where 9 agents selected O-L-D and 9 agents O-R-D consistently yielded decent payoffs, hinting at a better balance.
   - Averaging out the trend, participation seems to fluctuate slightly around these numbers, but extremes (like all agents choosing similar routes) cause drastic payoff changes.

3. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - Given the observed balance between number of agents choosing each route and the associated payoffs, a balanced approach tends to yield more consistent results.
   - Deciding on a route which seems slightly less popular in recent rounds could capitalize on the tendency of other agents normalizing between the two options. 
   - Around the latest round, Round 34, equal distribution pointed towards O-L-D being an advantageous choice. However, previously observed patterns (more agents fluctuating back to a strategy after equal rounds) indicate a potential for O-R-D to gather smaller numbers next.

Based on these observations and analyses, the strategic decision for the next round would be:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

This decision anticipates a potential shift from balanced distribution to slightly preferable participation in O-L-D again, leading to an optimal breakout over usual course.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To determine the optimal route for this round, let's analyze the data from the previous rounds and assess potential future outcomes:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: 
    - When the number of agents on the route you chose is balanced or in your favor, you got higher payoffs. 
    - High payoffs were observed when the other route was more crowded than the one you chose, or when the load was relatively balanced.
    - For instance, choosing O-R-D when less than 9 players took it usually resulted in good payoffs.

2. **Balancing Agent Count**: 
    - The payoff balance often lies around 9-9 or a slightly unbalanced split (favoring the lesser crowded route). 
    - When O-L-D had 13 and O-R-D had 5 agents, route O-L-D resulted in a low payoff for you but higher than normal for those on O-R-D.

3. **Response to Other Agents**: 
    - Alternating between routes seems to yield better chances of a higher payoff as players adjust their choices based on prior rounds.
    - Participants seem to switch often, hoping for the less congested route, so exploit this behavior.

4. **Recent Trends**: 
    - Recent rounds seem to have participants slightly more on O-R-D (e.g., 11 agents seen more than once).
    - O-L-D with 7-8 agents was a relatively favorable condition.

5. **Strategic Choice**:
    - Since your last round on O-R-D had 11, your most recent O-L-D experience was not optimal (9-9 split), there's a chance shifting back to O-L-D might see fewer agents now as those on O-R-D may switch.

Given this analysis, choosing O-L-D this round may yield a more favorable outcome based on alternating strategy and recent trends.

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To determine the best route for the upcoming round, we'll analyze the patterns from the previous rounds to try and predict the behavior of other agents and maximize our payoff.

### Analysis of Previous Rounds:
- **High Payoff Rounds**: The rounds where I received the highest payoffs were when there was a more balanced distribution of agents on both routes or when I chose the less congested route.
  - Example: Round 6, I chose O-R-D, there were 11 agents on O-L-D, received a payoff of 120.
  - Example: Round 9, I chose O-R-D, there were 13 agents on O-L-D, received a payoff of 140.
  - Example: Round 31, I chose O-R-D, there were 11 agents on O-L-D, received a payoff of 120.
  
- **Repeated Mid Payoff Rounds**: Often, when the agent distribution was equal or when many agents chose O-R-D, my payoff was approximately between 70 and 100.
  - Example: Round 7, both routes had 9 agents each, received a payoff of 100.
  
- **Low Payoff Rounds**: The rounds with very low payoffs were typically when I was on the more congested route.
  - Example: Round 3, I chose O-R-D, all 18 agents were on O-R-D, received a payoff of 10.

### Strategy:
1. **Predict the Less Congested Route**: Based on the data, many low payoffs occurred when selecting the route with the highest congestion. The strategy is to choose the less congested route.
   
2. **Analyze Trends**: Check how many times agents switch as a group; patterns show that participants tend to switch routes after congested experiences, trying to balance their choices.

3. **Adjust Decisions**: Balance between predicting the trend while also reacting to the continual swing in agent choices to maximize payoffs based on congestion fluctuation.

### Decision for Next Round:
Observing the recent pattern, there's a tendency for relatively balanced or slightly skewed distribution after high congestion events. Furthermore, in current observations, slightly fewer agents sometimes pick O-L-D following it being popular. 

Considering all of this:

- **Likely less congested route**: O-R-D
- Payoff from O-R-D had high values when O-L-D was more popular in the past few rounds. 
- Historically, the pattern post high congestion on one side leads to moderate congestion balancing.

Based on these points, the recommended route for the next round is "O-R-D".

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To choose the optimal route for the next round, let's analyze the patterns and outcomes from previous rounds:

1. **Payoff Patterns**: 
    - O-R-D tends to provide a higher payoff when fewer participants choose it (e.g., rounds 6, 9, 31).
    - O-L-D provides better payoffs under similar circumstances (e.g., rounds 22).

2. **Participant Patterns**:
    - When the distribution of agents is balanced (roughly 9 on each route), the payoff tends to be around 100.
    - Traditionally, one route ends up carrying the majority of participants (e.g., round 2, 19) which significantly impacts the payoff. Switching to the less crowded route in such situations yields a better payoff.

3. **Recent Trends**:
    - More recent rounds suggest a slight preference for O-R-D, but both routes hover around equilibrium, with occasional significant shifts.
    - The latest round (37) had 11 participants choosing O-R-D, resulting in an 80 payoff, suggesting a possible cohort direction towards O-L-D in the next round.

4. **Decision**: 
    - I should aim to select the route that fewer participants are expected to choose. Given recent trends, there's a possibility that participants might move towards O-L-D to avoid congestion. However, predicting exactly can be challenging, but based on recent data, O-R-D has had 11 participants frequently.

Given these insights and the likelihood that drivers might switch to O-L-D to escape recent congestion in O-R-D, I will choose the route that might still have fewer participants based on observed trends:

The available routes are: ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To decide on the best route choice for the next round, let's analyze the patterns and outcomes from the past rounds:

1. **Identify Patterns in Agent Distribution**:
    - The number of agents choosing the routes varies significantly from round to round.
    - Balanced scenarios (around 9 agents each) seem to result in decent payoffs because the marginal cost imposed by the choice is not extreme for either route.

2. **Assess Payoff Trends**:
    - Payoffs around or above 100 are generally received when the distribution is balanced or when fewer agents choose the same route as you (e.g., 7 vs. 11).
    - High payoffs from the O-L-D route were achieved when fewer drivers picked it (e.g., 6, 7 agents).
    - Higher payoffs for choosing O-R-D were noted when fewer agents picked it (e.g., 7, 8 agents).

3. **Predict the Likely Choices of Others**:
   - High payoffs on O-R-D when 11 agents were on O-L-D and vice versa mean if the past trends hold, one group may choose one route, expecting others will primarily choose the other route.
    - Recurrence of similar agent distribution in recent rounds: 9-9 distributions and other combinations indicate more stable preferences after trying extreme choices early on.
   
4. **Optimize for Expected Lower Congestion**:
    - Based on the recent rounds, where choices resulted in an average near 9 agents per route, it might be indicative of increasing balancing decisions by all agents. 
    - Recent rounds of alternating between substantial payoff and average payoff suggest a trial and error adjustment toward the 9-9 balance.
  
5. **Decision**:
    - Considering the balance in recent rounds and my historical payoff maximized when choosing O-R-D, it might be worthwhile to attempt O-R-D again, as other participants might opt for O-L-D thinking others will choose O-R-D, maintaining a balanced distribution or slightly higher on their part.

Taking these observations into account, I choose the route with the potential to yield a higher payoff based on typical rounds with similar distributions. Therefore, I will choose:

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output:
To make a decision for Round 40, let's analyze the historical data provided. Here are some observations:

1. **Route Selection Dynamics:**
   - Route O-R-D seems to be preferred when fewer agents choose it, as indicated by rounds where Route O-R-D had fewer than ~10 participants, and payoffs were higher (e.g., Rounds 1, 6, 9, 31).

2. **Route O-L-D Prospects:**
   - Route O-L-D yielded better payoffs when fewer agents were on it (e.g., Rounds 22, 27, 28 with payoffs of 120, 100, 130 respectively with fewer agents).

3. **Alternating Behavior:** 
   - Participants appear to frequently switch between routes, likely seeking the route with fewer drivers each round.

4. **Recent Trends:**
   - The recent rounds show alternating patterns with Route O-R-D being more crowded in Rounds 39, 37, and 35, while Route O-L-D had higher traffic in rounds like 38.

5. **Payoff Consistency:** 
   - Consistent payoffs around 80-120 suggest this might be a more balanced distribution where both routes have similar or equal number of agents.

Given this analysis, here’s the strategic approach:

- **Prediction of Other Participants' Choices:** Based on alternating behavior, drivers may move back to Route O-R-D in Round 40 after observing higher crowds in O-L-D in Round 38 and having some consistent crowding in previous rounds like 36 and 39 on O-R-D.

- **Maximize the Payoff by Choosing the Less Crowded Route:** The pattern suggests that Round 40 might see a switch again, but a clearer picture emerges from alternating behavior. It's plausible some will choose O-R-D expecting fewer competitors. However, given that recent O-L-D choices also yielded unexpectedly high participants, the risk could be managed by strategically testing one last O-L-D choice.

Thus, for maximizing payoff in Round 40, going with Route **O-L-D** seems to have a strategic edge based on historical preference changes, though both routes are almost equally viable given recent balances. 

Here's the formatted decision:

{
  "route": "O-L-D"
