System: 
You're James Taylor, a 55-year-old architect.
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 20 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O A B D
Edges and associated costs:
Edge O to A, cost function: 10 * X
Edge O to B, cost function: 210
Edge A to D, cost function: 210
Edge B to D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-A-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-A to travel from O to A plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment A-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-B-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment B-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-A and B-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments A-D and O-B is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point S at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-A-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-B-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 X 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-B-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-A-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 X 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 20 rounds have exactly the same structure.


Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: ```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 17, 'O-B-D': 1}
Your cost was 380

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Based on the observations from the last round where the majority chose 'O-A-D', resulting in a high cost, I will select the alternative route 'O-B-D'.

```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 1, 'O-B-D': 17}
Your cost was 380

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Since the majority chose 'O-B-D' in the last round, leading to a high cost on that route, I will opt for the alternative route 'O-A-D' this time.

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 18, 'O-B-D': 0}
Your cost was 390

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given that all 18 participants chose 'O-A-D' in the last round, leading to a high cost, it might be strategic to choose the less crowded route 'O-B-D' this time.

```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 1, 'O-B-D': 17}
Your cost was 380

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the historical pattern where choosing the less crowded route tends to result in a lower cost, I will opt for 'O-A-D' this time in the hopes that others will continue to choose 'O-B-D'.

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 18, 'O-B-D': 0}
Your cost was 390

the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Since all participants seem to be switching back and forth between routes, causing high costs on the chosen route, I will select the less crowded route from the previous round. Knowing that the majority picked 'O-A-D' last time, I will go with 'O-B-D' this round.

```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 1, 'O-B-D': 17}

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Considering the consistent pattern where the majority of participants end up on 'O-B-D' causing high costs, I will choose the less crowded route 'O-A-D' this round.

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 18, 'O-B-D': 0}

the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Since all participants have repeatedly chosen 'O-A-D', resulting in high costs, it is likely that 'O-B-D' will be less crowded and thus incur a lower cost this round. I will choose 'O-B-D'.

```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 2, 'O-B-D': 16}
Your cost was 370

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the trend of participants switching between routes and considering that a smaller number chose 'O-A-D' last round, it may be advantageous to select 'O-A-D' this time for a potentially lower cost.

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 18, 'O-B-D': 0}

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the consistent pattern of everyone crowding onto 'O-A-D', it seems likely that 'O-B-D' will be less crowded and thus less costly this round. I will choose 'O-B-D'.

```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 1, 'O-B-D': 17}

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the high cost associated with the majority choosing 'O-B-D' last round, and the low number of drivers on 'O-A-D', it would be strategic to choose 'O-A-D' this round for a potentially lower cost.

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 18, 'O-B-D': 0}

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the recurring pattern where everyone crowds onto 'O-A-D', leading to high costs, it seems likely that 'O-B-D' will be less crowded and thus less costly this round. I will choose 'O-B-D'.

```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the pattern where 'O-A-D' has been less crowded in the rounds following heavy usage of 'O-B-D', it would be strategic to choose 'O-A-D' this round for a potentially lower cost.

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 18, 'O-B-D': 0}

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the consistent trend where 'O-A-D' has been heavily crowded, leading to high costs, it would logically be more advantageous to choose 'O-B-D' this round for potentially lower costs.

```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"

```

AI: Given the consistent pattern where all participants crowd onto 'O-A-D', resulting in high costs, it seems reasonable to expect that 'O-B-D' will be the less crowded and less costly route this round. Therefore, I will choose 'O-B-D'.
