System: 
You're Patricia Lee, a 32-year-old photographer.
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 20 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O A B D
Edges and associated costs:
Edge O to A, cost function: 10 * X
Edge O to B, cost function: 210
Edge A to D, cost function: 210
Edge B to D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-A-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-A to travel from O to A plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment A-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-B-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment B-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-A and B-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments A-D and O-B is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point S at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-A-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-B-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 X 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-B-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-A-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 X 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 20 rounds have exactly the same structure.


Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Based on the provided schema, here’s the JSON output with my chosen route:

```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 17, 'O-B-D': 1}
Your cost was 220

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the information from the last round, it seems that the vast majority of players chose route 'O-A-D'. This resulted in a high cost for that route due to the number of players. Conversely, 'O-B-D' had a much lower cost due to fewer players using it.

To optimize my payoff, it might be strategic to choose the less popular but potentially less costly route considering the previous round’s distribution of players.

Here’s the JSON output with my selected route:

```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 1, 'O-B-D': 17}
Your cost was 380

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Based on the past round where the majority of players chose route 'O-B-D', causing its cost to be very high, it would be strategic to anticipate that others might switch to 'O-A-D' in this round to avoid the high cost.

Therefore, a more advantageous route choice would be:

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 18, 'O-B-D': 0}
Your cost was 390

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the pattern of choices and the high cost on the route 'O-A-D' due to all players selecting it in the last round, it is likely that many players will switch to the less crowded route 'O-B-D' this round.

To optimize the payoff, it might be strategic to choose the route that was not chosen by any player last round:

```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 1, 'O-B-D': 17}
Your cost was 380

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the pattern where participants seem to oscillate between the two routes, and considering the last round where almost everyone chose 'O-B-D' leading to high costs, it would be strategic to choose the less crowded route.

Here's the JSON response with the selected route:

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 18, 'O-B-D': 0}
Your cost was 390

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the observed pattern, it seems that the participants are alternating between the two routes to minimize their costs. Since 'O-A-D' was heavily used in the last round, leading to high costs, it is likely that many participants will switch to 'O-B-D' this round.

To optimize my payoff, I will choose the less crowded route:

```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 1, 'O-B-D': 17}
Your cost was 380

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the pattern where participants are presumably alternating routes to minimize costs, and considering that 'O-A-D' had fewer participants in the last round, leading to lower costs, it would be strategic to choose the route that was less crowded last round:

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 18, 'O-B-D': 0}
Your cost was 390

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: The previous patterns indicate that participants heavily switched between the two routes to spread the cost. When one route became heavily used and expensive, participants switched to the other route in the next round. Given that last round had all participants on 'O-A-D' resulting in high costs, I anticipate that many will switch to 'O-B-D' this round.

Therefore, to avoid the likely crowded route 'O-B-D', I will choose:

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 2, 'O-B-D': 16}
Your cost was 230

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Considering that in the last round, 'O-B-D' was overwhelmingly more crowded and thus more costly compared to 'O-A-D', it would be strategic to select the less crowded route.

Here’s my choice formatted according to the provided schema:

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 18, 'O-B-D': 0}
Your cost was 390

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the repeated pattern of participants switching between the two routes to avoid high costs, coupled with the fact that all players chose 'O-A-D' in the last round resulting in high costs, it's logical to anticipate that most other participants will shift to 'O-B-D' this round to seek lower costs.

To strategically avoid the crowd and minimize cost, I will choose:

```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 1, 'O-B-D': 17}
Your cost was 380

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the previous patterns, I see that whenever one route becomes very crowded and costly, players tend to switch to the other route. Since 'O-B-D' was heavily used and costly in the last round, it is likely that many participants will switch to 'O-A-D' this round.

To optimize my payoff, I will choose the less crowded route from the previous round:

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 18, 'O-B-D': 0}
Your cost was 390

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the pattern where participants are oscillating between the two routes to minimize their costs, and the fact that 'O-B-D' was completely empty in the last round, making it the less expensive option this time, it is likely most participants will switch to 'O-B-D' now.

To avoid the crowd and minimize my cost, I will choose:

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 2, 'O-B-D': 16}
Your cost was 230

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Based on the previous round's numbers, where 'O-B-D' was significantly more crowded and costly, and 'O-A-D' had a much lower cost due to fewer players, it would be strategic to choose the less crowded route.

Here’s my choice formatted according to the provided schema:

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 18, 'O-B-D': 0}
Your cost was 390

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the pattern, players seem to continuously switch to whichever route was less crowded in the previous round to minimize costs. Since last round 'O-A-D' was heavily used and resulted in high costs, it is likely that many participants will switch to 'O-B-D' this round.

To optimize the payoff and avoid the likely crowded route, I will choose:

```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 1, 'O-B-D': 17}
Your cost was 380

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the established pattern where participants seem to choose the less crowded route from the previous round, and the fact that 'O-B-D' was heavily used and costly in the last round, it would make sense to anticipate that many participants will switch to 'O-A-D' this round.

To minimize the cost and avoid the likely crowded route, I will choose:

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 18, 'O-B-D': 0}
Your cost was 390

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Based on the identified pattern, it is apparent that participants tend to switch to whichever route was less crowded in the previous round. Given that 'O-A-D' was heavily crowded last round, making it expensive, participants are likely to switch to 'O-B-D' this round.

To optimize my payoff by avoiding the crowd, I will choose:

```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 1, 'O-B-D': 17}
Your cost was 380

the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the oscillation pattern where participants heavily use one route and switch the next round, it is likely that participants will switch en masse to 'O-A-D' this round, given that 'O-B-D' was heavily used last round.

To optimize for the least crowded route and hence the lowest cost, I will choose:

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 18, 'O-B-D': 0}
Your cost was 390

Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-B-D']

the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the consistent pattern and the high cost on 'O-A-D' due to heavy usage in the last round, the rational choice would be to avoid the more likely crowded route. Since participants tend to switch to the less crowded route, it is reasonable to anticipate that many will switch to 'O-B-D' this round.

Given this, I choose:

```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 1, 'O-B-D': 17}
Your cost was 380

the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Considering the previous patterns where the majority of participants switch routes to avoid high costs, and the fact that 'O-B-D' was heavily used in the last round, resulting in high costs, it would be strategic to choose the less crowded route.

Here’s my choice formatted according to the provided schema:

```json
{
  "route": "O-A-D"
}
```

Human: Last round, the number of players on each route was: {'O-A-D': 18, 'O-B-D': 0}

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: Given the observed oscillating pattern, it seems participants consistently switch to the route that was less crowded in the previous round. Since 'O-A-D' was heavily crowded last round, causing high costs, it is anticipated that participants will switch to 'O-B-D' this round.

To optimize for the lowest cost, I will choose:

```json
{
  "route": "O-B-D"
}
```
