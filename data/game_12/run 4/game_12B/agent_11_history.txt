System Message: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make an informed decision on the choice of route, let's analyze the cost function for each route, considering the factors impacting the travel cost: the segment costs and the number of participants choosing specific segments.

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost: \( 10X + 210 \)
   - The cost on segment O-L depends on the number of participants who choose this segment.
   - Segment L-D has a fixed cost of 210.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Cost: \( 10X + 0 + 10Y \)
   - The cost on segment O-L depends on the number of participants who choose this segment.
   - L-R has a fixed cost of 0.
   - The cost on segment R-D depends on the number of participants choosing this segment.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost: \( 210 + 10Y \)
   - Segment O-R has a fixed cost of 210.
   - The cost on segment R-D depends on the number of participants choosing this segment.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

- **Cost Considerations:**
  - Routes with variable costs (O-L, R-D segments) will become expensive as more drivers choose them.
  
- **Route O-L-D:**
  - Higher cost variability due to \( 10X \).
  - Ideal if few participants choose segment O-L.

- **Route O-L-R-D:**
  - Variable costs on both segments O-L and R-D.
  - Cost increases as participants on either segment increase.

- **Route O-R-D:**
  - Fixed initial cost plus variable \( 10Y \) on segment R-D.
  - Predictable initial cost with variability only from R-D.

**Conclusion:**
- **Route O-R-D** has a predictable fixed cost on segment O-R, which limits the variability.
- It may be optimal if we expect fewer participants on segment R-D, balancing the \( 210 \) cost with a controlled setting for the additional \( 10Y \).
  
Taking into account these analyses and the desire to minimize costs, the recommended choice is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}

Summary of previous rounds:
  Round 1:
    Your Choice: O-R-D
    Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 6, 'O-L-R-D': 12}
    Your Regret: 80

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make an informed decision, let's analyze the costs for each route based on the information available and considering potential actions of other drivers.

1. **Analyze Route Options:**
   - **Route O-L-D:**
     - Total cost = 10 * X + 210
     - Requires traveling through segments O-L and L-D.
     - Costs depend on the number of drivers selecting O-L, i.e., X.

   - **Route O-L-R-D:**
     - Total cost = 10 * X + 0 + 10 * Y
     - Requires traveling through segments O-L, L-R, and R-D.
     - Costs depend on the number of drivers on O-L (X) and R-D (Y).
     - Previous round distribution had 12 drivers on this route.

   - **Route O-R-D:**
     - Total cost = 210 + 10 * Y
     - Requires traveling through segments O-R and R-D.
     - Costs depend on the number of drivers on R-D (Y).

2. **Previous Round Insights:**
   - Route O-R-D had 6 drivers, including yourself. Your regret was 80, which means the cost (you incurred) was higher than optimal.
   - Route O-L-R-D had 12 drivers, which potentially avoided the fixed cost on L-D, but the overall cost was influenced by the number of drivers on R-D.

3. **Estimate Potential Costs:**
   - **O-L-D:**
     - If no one or very few choose O-L-D, cost could be low. But if many switch due to avoiding the extra traveled legs in O-L-R-D, it might increase the shared segment cost.

   - **O-L-R-D:**
     - High driver count on this route previously, but it avoids the fixed segment costs. Shared segment costs could still be significant due to multiple drivers using O-L.

   - **O-R-D:**
     - Consists of a consistent cost with fewer routes. If drivers reduce here thinking others will switch, cost may increase on its secondary segment (R-D).

4. **Strategic Decision:**
   - **Avoid Regret:** To minimize potential cost and the regret experienced, consider switching from O-R-D.
   - **Experiment Consideration:** Testing O-L-D may provide insight into whether the shared O-L cost can be manageable with potentially fewer drivers.
   - **Adaptive Play:** Since many chose O-L-R-D previously, they might continue, potentially reducing total cost on segment O-L for fewer users.

Given this analysis, opting for route O-L-R-D again may prove cost-effective unless everyone drastically changes their choices, which is unpredictable without pattern recognition over multiple rounds. 

**Decision:**

{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 11.
Summary of previous rounds:
  Round 1:
    Your Choice: O-R-D
    Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 6, 'O-L-R-D': 12}
    Your Regret: 80
  Round 2:
    Your Choice: O-L-R-D
    Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-R-D': 17, 'O-L-D': 1}
    Your Regret: 0

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To decide on the optimal route for the next round, let's analyze the information from the previous rounds and consider possible strategies:

### Round 1 Analysis
- **Your Choice:** O-R-D
- **Route Choice Distribution:** {'O-R-D': 6, 'O-L-R-D': 12}
- **Your Regret:** 80

In Round 1, you chose O-R-D. With 6 participants choosing O-R-D, the cost would be \(210 + 10 \times 6 = 270\). The endowment is 400, so your payoff was \(400 - 270 = 130\). The regret of 80 suggests that another route offered a better payoff.

### Round 2 Analysis
- **Your Choice:** O-L-R-D
- **Route Choice Distribution:** {'O-L-R-D': 17, 'O-L-D': 1}
- **Your Regret:** 0

In Round 2, you switched to O-L-R-D. With 17 participants choosing this route, the cost was \(10 \times 17 + 0 = 170\), so the payoff was \(400 - 170 = 230\). Since the regret was 0, this was the optimal choice for that distribution of drivers.

### Key Insights
- **O-L-R-D** in Round 2 gave an optimal payoff with no regret, even with a high number of people choosing it.
- **O-R-D** had a significant regret in Round 1, indicating a worse payoff compared to other options.
- **O-L-D** was not chosen by you so far, but in Round 2, it was chosen by only 1 person. If you were to choose it alone or with few others, it could potentially have a lower cost.

### Decision Making for Next Round

1. **Consider O-L-R-D** since it yielded no regret in Round 2.
2. **Monitor Choice Trends:** Pay attention to how others are choosing. If O-L-D consistently remains underchosen, it might present a strategic opportunity.
3. **Flexibility:** If the pattern stabilizes where less people choose O-R-D or you suspect a switch by many to O-L-D, consider retrying O-R-D.

### Conclusion

Choosing **O-L-R-D** seems optimal based on the current trends; it provided no regret previously and is likely to remain competitive unless a drastic shift happens.

    Your Regret: 0

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: In order to make an informed decision about which route to choose, let's break down the factors and considerations:

1. **Route Costs**: 
    - **O-L-D**: The cost is 10X + 210, where X is the number of drivers choosing O-L. 
    - **O-L-R-D**: The cost is 10X + 0 + 10Y, where X is the number choosing O-L and Y is the number choosing R-D.
    - **O-R-D**: The cost is 210 + 10Y, where Y is the number choosing R-D.

2. **Endowment**: At the beginning of each round, you get an endowment of 400 points. The aim is to minimize travel costs to maximize your remaining points.

3. **Recently observed distribution and personal scores**:
    - In the previous rounds, the choices have been mostly split between O-L-R-D and O-R-D, with O-L-D being the least chosen.
    - Your regrets have been 80 when you chose O-R-D and 0 when you chose O-L-R-D, indicating lower costs for O-L-R-D under the observed conditions.

4. **Recent Observations**:
    - Round 1 had 12 people choosing O-L-R-D and 6 choosing O-R-D. Your regret with O-R-D suggests that a large number of people choosing O-R-D led to high costs on R-D.
    - During Rounds 2 and 3, the choice O-L-R-D seemed more favorable considering no regrets were involved, likely indicating a balanced distribution of drivers on the segments costing you less.

5. **Predictive Choice**:
    - Expectation suggests that O-L-R-D might be the safer choice, considering it yielded no regret earlier, indicating possibly balanced usage of segments minimizing costs.
    - If the distribution from past rounds slightly holds, O-L-R-D may potentially remain optimal due to the avoidance of high direct costs on any single segment.

Decision: Choose the route **O-L-R-D** again, as it seems to consistently yield lower costs and thus higher payoffs based on previous rounds. 

Applying this reasoning under uncertainty principles, the balanced route could likely remain the most cost-efficient under similar future distributions of choices. 

Thus, the JSON output reflecting this decision would be:

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make the best decision regarding which route to choose, we'll analyze the information from the previous rounds and the cost functions of each segment. Here’s the step-by-step thought process:

1. **Objective**: Maximize payoff, which means minimizing travel costs each round. Each round starts with an endowment of 400 points, and travel costs are subtracted from this endowment.

2. **Route Costs**:
   - **O-L-D**: Cost is `10X + 210` where X is number of drivers choosing O-L.
   - **O-L-R-D**: Cost is `10X + 0 + 10Y` where X is for O-L and Y is for R-D.
   - **O-R-D**: Cost is `210 + 10Y` where Y is number of drivers choosing R-D.

3. **Review Past Rounds**:
   - **Round 1**: Chose O-R-D and experienced regret with a crowded R-D segment costing more.
   - **Round 2**: Chose O-L-R-D, no regret. 17 drivers chose O-L-R-D which indicates it might be a popular but low-cost option.
   - **Round 3**: Chose O-L-R-D, no regret. Distribution was diverse but O-L-R-D was most popular.
   - **Round 4**: Chose O-L-R-D, no regret. Most drivers chose O-L-R-D, hinting it may consistently yield lower costs.

4. **Current Strategy**:
   - Given the success of O-L-R-D in rounds 2, 3, and 4 with no regret, this indicates the strategy is effectively minimizing costs, likely through balancing the traffic between the O-L and R-D segments.
   - The strategy to balance the segment load between O-L and R-D segments effectively results in possibly fewer competing drivers on each segment.
   - O-R-D poses a risk due to typically higher numbers on the R-D segment contributing to increased costs, observed in Round 1.
   - The mysterious fixed cost of O-L-D could be a mislead by participants not calculating based on hypothetical congestion they incur.

5. **Prediction and Decision**:
   - Based on previous rounds' behavior, expect O-L-R-D to continue being a balanced choice.
   - It appears that other drivers might follow similar logic due to observed past distributions.
   - Stick with O-L-R-D for consistent performance and cost prediction.

Based on this analysis, the chosen route should be O-L-R-D.

    Your Regret: 0

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: Let's examine the options step-by-step based on the information we've gathered from the previous rounds.

1. **Route O-L-D**:
    - Cost = 10X + 210
    - This route is potentially high-cost because if more drivers choose O-L, the cost will increase linearly with the number of drivers (X) going from O to L.
    - From previous rounds, we note that this route was chosen very infrequently, which implies unpredictable costs but possibly lower if the segment O-L is not heavily trafficked.

2. **Route O-L-R-D**:
    - Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y
    - This route has been chosen by many participants including myself in the previous rounds. 
    - Although X has been relatively high due to the popularity of O-L-R-D, the payoff has been consistent with minimal regrets in the last few rounds, suggesting this route provides an optimal balance between the costs of segments O-L and R-D.

3. **Route O-R-D**:
    - Cost = 210 + 10Y
    - The initial choice led to higher costs because of the frequency of others choosing this route, resulting in increased costs on R-D.
    - This route involves a fixed cost of 210, similar to O-L-D, but since Y is generally higher on R-D, the variability depends on how many other drivers chose this route.

**Analysis of Past Choices**:
- Choosing O-L-R-D consistently resulted in minimal regret suggesting it was often the least expensive or comparable to the least-cost option.
- O-R-D initially seemed a poor choice based on participant distribution and subsequent regret.
- O-L-D hasn't been a popular choice, which makes its cost less predictable and potentially risky given the fixed nature of L-D costs.

Given the trend and aim to minimize costs:

**Conclusion**: The most prudent choice, based on previous patterns where selecting O-L-R-D hasn't incurred any regret in recent rounds, is to choose **O-L-R-D** again. This choice balances the initially expected and actual costs effectively, minimizing unexpected high costs due to fluctuations in other participants' choices.

LLM Output: To make a decision, let's analyze the situation based on the information from previous rounds and the available routes:

### Recap of Previous Rounds:
1. **Round 1:**
   - **Choice:** O-R-D
   - **Distribution:** 6 on O-R-D, 12 on O-L-R-D
   - **Regret:** 80 (indicating high travel cost compared to other choices)
   
2. **Round 2 to 6:**
   - **Choice:** O-L-R-D
   - **Results:** No regret in Rounds 2-6, meaning the cost was minimized in those rounds.
   - **Distribution:** Most drivers choosing O-L-R-D

### Strategy:
- **O-L-R-D Performance:** From Rounds 2-6, choosing O-L-R-D resulted in zero regret, which means it was likely the optimal route in terms of cost efficiency.
- **Cost Analysis:** The cost of O-L-R-D involves segments O-L and R-D. The segment L-R is free (0 cost), and historically, less congestion is observed on O-L and R-D when choosing O-L-R-D as a larger group prefers this route.
- **Peer Influence:** The trend shows a majority of drivers are selecting O-L-R-D. Joining this route reduces individual congestion-based costs due to the distribution of O-L and R-D with many participants.
  
### Current Situation:
Given that in the previous rounds, O-L-R-D had no regret, and the distribution favored O-L-R-D heavily, selecting O-L-R-D seems to be a safer and cost-efficient strategy. This route consistently had zero regret, suggesting lower congestion costs compared to other routes under current dynamics.

### Decision:
Choose the route **O-L-R-D**. This decision is based on observed patterns and the minimization of costs and regrets from previous rounds.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make an informed decision about which route to choose, let's evaluate each route's potential cost based on the historical data from the previous rounds:

1. **O-L-D**: 
   - Cost is calculated as 10 * number of users on segment O-L + 210.
   - In the previous rounds, this route was chosen infrequently, which means it might likely get a higher number of users on O-L if everyone suddenly shifts. However, in Round 2 and Round 3, when there were only 1 or 2 users, the cost was likely higher because your choice in those rounds was O-L-R-D, which proved to have no regret. Choosing this route is a gamble, possibly viable if others don't choose it at the same time.

2. **O-L-R-D**: 
   - Cost is calculated as 10 * number of users on segment O-L + 0 + 10 * number of users on segment R-D.
   - Since choosing this route in recent rounds consistently resulted in zero regret and the route is continuously popular, it's evidence that it offers, relatively, the most balanced cost-effectiveness. In Round 2 with 17 choosing this and 1 user choosing O-L-D, the zero regret shows it minimized cost for you compared to alternatives.

3. **O-R-D**: 
   - Cost is calculated as 210 + 10 * number of users on segment R-D.
   - In Round 1, when you chose this route and 6 chose O-R-D, your regret was 80. This indicates that with 6 users, the cost was less optimal compared to the other route options. Also, in subsequent rounds, it was rarely chosen, suggesting others found it costlier under the conditions.

**Conclusion**:
The route O-L-R-D has consistently shown to be advantageous over several rounds, minimizing travel cost in many configurations of user distributions. It minimizes segment costs by taking advantage of the 0 cost on segment L-R and balances the distribution across O-L and R-D, especially when others also choose this route.

Given historical outcomes and distribution patterns, choosing the route **O-L-R-D** is advisable.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make an informed decision about which route to choose, let's analyze the information provided from the previous rounds and the game's mechanics:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to minimize travel costs to maximize payoffs. Given a starting endowment of 400 points, any cost less than 400 will yield a positive payoff.

2. **Cost Structure**:
   - Route O-L-D: Cost = 10 * X (number of participants choosing O-L) + 210
   - Route O-L-R-D: Cost = 10 * X (for segment O-L, common with O-L-D) + 0 + 10 * Y (for segment R-D, shared with O-R-D).
   - Route O-R-D: Cost = 210 + 10 * Y (number of participants choosing R-D)
  
3. **Past Outcomes**:
   - Round 1 shows that choosing O-L-R-D when O-R-D and O-L-R-D are popular could be costly (Regret of 80).
   - In Rounds 2-8, consistently choosing O-L-R-D resulted in zero regrets, indicating that it might be the optimal route under those distributions.
   - Every scenario where you chose O-L-R-D resulted in 0 regret, and the distributions indicate heavy leaning towards O-L-R-D, suggesting effective minimization of costs. Other players tend to (almost entirely) choose this route too.

4. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - In most rounds, a majority or all players selected O-L-R-D.
   - Route O-L-D and O-R-D were almost avoided or only minimally chosen by other players in the recent rounds, suggesting these choices might have lesser benefits or higher costs.

5. **Strategy Decision**:
   - The consistent zero regret when choosing O-L-R-D implies that this route minimized costs effectively in past rounds.
   - Adopting economically viable paths based on trend data from recent rounds suggests stability in decision-making.
  
Given the above analysis, and since previous rounds show O-L-R-D as the least regrettable choice with the current player behavior, it would be strategic to continue with the route O-L-R-D unless a significant change is detected in other players' behavior in subsequent rounds.

Therefore, I will choose route O-L-R-D.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make a decision on which route to choose, let's analyze the situation step-by-step.

1. **Understanding Costs:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** Cost = 10X + 210, where X is the number of participants choosing segment O-L.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y, where X is the number of participants choosing segment O-L and Y is the number of participants choosing segment R-D.
   - **Route O-R-D:** Cost = 210 + 10Y, where Y is the number of participants choosing segment R-D.

2. **Evaluating Previous Rounds:**
   - You've consistently chosen the route O-L-R-D from Round 2 onwards, with zero regret.
   - The route O-L-R-D has been heavily chosen, suggesting participants perceive it as optimal given others' choices.
   - Your only regret was in Round 1 when you chose O-R-D, suggesting that route was costlier.

3. **Routes and Costs Analysis:**
   - **O-L-D:** Has not been a common choice. It might become costly if many start choosing it, due to the 10X cost component.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Despite many choosing it, your regret has been consistently zero, suggesting that in the current distribution, this route is optimal.
   - **O-R-D:** Initially chosen, but resulted in regret, likely due to higher costs when many others selected it.

4. **Strategy Moving Forward:**
   - Shifting to O-L-D or O-R-D might result in higher cost if current trends continue.
   - Staying with O-L-R-D seems optimal based on historical data, assuming similar choices by others.

5. **Conclusion:**
   Given that the route O-L-R-D has yielded zero regret and cost-effective choices in past rounds, especially in the last few rounds where all participants chose this route, it is reasonable to continue with route O-L-R-D. This route seems to balance the costs effectively given the past behaviors of the other participants.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: Given the structure of the game and the data from previous rounds, here is a step-by-step reasoning to make the decision for the next route choice:

1. **Goal:** The goal is to minimize travel costs and regrets, thereby maximizing the payoff.

2. **Previous Choices and Outcomes:** 
   - Round 1: Choice was O-R-D. Regret was high (80), indicating it was not a cost-effective route as many participants also chose it.
   - Rounds 2 to 10: Chose O-L-R-D. Regret was 0 for all rounds since then, even as the number of participants choosing this route increased to 18 out of 18 in the later rounds.

3. **Analysis of Route Costs:**
   - **O-L-D**: The cost depends on the number of drivers choosing segment O-L plus a fixed cost of 210. Given the previous rounds, if all 18 drivers choose O-L, the cost will be 10*18 + 210 = 390, which is quite high.
   - **O-L-R-D**: The cost primarily involves the segment O-L, which is also influenced by the number of drivers. However, as observed, choosing this route seems to have resulted in 0 regrets consistently when many drivers chose it, suggesting lower effective costs due to efficiencies on this route.
   - **O-R-D**: It has a fixed cost of 210 for O-R plus the variable cost on R-D. Similar to O-L, if fewer people choose it, this could be less costly, but historically, when chosen as a group, it led to higher regrets.

4. **Group Dynamics:** 
   - It's evident that when more people choose a specific route, it affects the cost due to variable costs on certain segments.
   - Given the pattern, O-L-R-D has been a dominant choice with 0 regrets, indicating either balanced distribution or some efficiency due to route structure, even with the full group.

5. **Strategic Decision:**
   - Considering all participants' inclination towards O-L-R-D and the negligible regrets in earlier rounds, this route emerges as the safest and potentially most cost-effective option under current conditions.
  
6. **Conclusion:** 
   - Stick with what has worked well in past rounds since it has proven to be effective. The group dynamics and cost structure favor O-L-R-D under current preferences and previous outcomes.

Therefore, for the next round, the choice is:

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make an informed decision for the next round, let's analyze the data from the previous rounds and evaluate the costs and benefits associated with each available route:

1. **Understanding the Costs:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** The cost on this route is determined by the segment O-L (10X) and the fixed cost on segment L-D (210). Therefore, the total cost is 10X + 210.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** The cost here is 10X for segment O-L and a fixed cost of 0 for segment L-R, plus 10Y for segment R-D. Thus, the cost is 10X + 10Y.
   - **Route O-R-D:** This route consists of a fixed cost on segment O-R (210) and 10Y on segment R-D, leading to a total cost of 210 + 10Y.

2. **Analyzing Previous Round Choices:**
   - In the initial round (Round 1), the use of route O-R-D incurred regret because all users on this route paid the higher variable cost on R-D.
   - Subsequently, choosing O-L-R-D consistently avoided regret. In every recorded instance, the participants only used this route, which means Y was indeed lower.
   - Through Rounds 2 to 11, the O-L-R-D route was chosen exclusively in your case and became quite popular with other agents, removing regret.

3. **Trend Observations:**
   - There's a significant trend indicating that the route O-L-R-D was picked solely in almost every recent round. This route resulted in minimized cost due to spreading traffic across segments effectively (due to zero cost at L-R).
   - The O-L-D and O-R-D routes have typically resulted in higher costs when they were chosen because of their fixed segment costs and vulnerable higher variable costs due to lone selections.

4. **Strategic Consideration:**
   - Given previous observations, the cost-efficiency of the route O-L-R-D is optimal (best distribution of variable and zero costs).
   - It's essential to consider whether options such as O-L-R-D remain uncontested as before, which seems consistent.
   
5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on history, sticking with O-L-R-D minimizes costs due to the zero-cost segment and spreads out loads evenly, reflecting a consistent pattern of contestant behavior that doesn’t penalize that choice.

With these analyses, the best decision for the next round is:

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To determine the best route decision for the next round, let's consider several factors based on the previous rounds' summaries:

1. **Regret Analysis**:
   - In Round 1, choosing **O-R-D** resulted in a regret of 80. This regret indicates a better alternative was available.
   - From Round 2 to Round 12, choosing **O-L-R-D** resulted in 0 regret consistently. This suggests that this choice was optimal given the distribution of other drivers in those rounds.

2. **Route Choice Distribution**:
   - **Rounds 2 to 12** consistently feature all or almost all participants choosing the route **O-L-R-D**. This indicates that, on average, others also find this route favorable in terms of minimizing cost.

3. **Cost Analysis**:
   - **Route O-L-R-D** incurs a cost related to the number of participants on segment **O-L**, but it also provides a consistent fixed cost on other segments which appears to be more optimal when shared amongst the majority.
   - If you deviate towards either **O-L-D** or **O-R-D**, the costs are likely to increase due to lesser participants, increasing variable costs on those segments alone.

4. **Predictability and Stability**:
   - Given that all participants, including you, consistently chose **O-L-R-D** from Round 6 onwards with 0 regret, it's a stable strategy. Others are expected to continue favoring it unless there's a sudden, unexplained shift in behavior.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the evidence from the previous rounds, the **O-L-R-D** route has minimized regrets and has been the consistently optimal choice across all these rounds. Unless new, unforeseen information comes to light or there's a change in participant behavior, sticking with this choice seems logical.

Therefore, the decision is to continue choosing the **O-L-R-D** route for the next round.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make an informed decision on which route to choose, let's analyze the past rounds and consider the cost implications:

1. **Understanding the Routes**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: The cost is \(10X + 210\). This route's cost depends heavily on the number of participants choosing the segment O-L.

   - **Route O-L-R-D**: The cost is \(10X + 0 + 10Y\). This route not only depends on the number of drivers on O-L but also on R-D.

   - **Route O-R-D**: The cost is \(210 + 10Y\). The cost largely depends on the segment R-D.

2. **Reviewing Past Performance**:
   - The initial choice of O-R-D in Round 1 resulted in significant regret (80) because of higher costs possibly due to the concentration of participants.
   
   - Subsequently, switching to O-L-R-D has consistently resulted in no regret. This suggests it has been the optimal choice historically.

3. **Analyzing Cost Drivers**:
   - The segment O-L was crowded in earlier rounds, which led to increased costs for those routes that involved O-L.
   
   - Since switching to O-L-R-D, this route appears to balance cost effectively, as seen by the absence of regret.

4. **Predicting Others' Behavior**:
   - Participants have consistently chosen O-L-R-D in the latest rounds, leading to a uniform distribution.
   - Based on this pattern, it's likely that others will continue selecting O-L-R-D, making costs predictable.

5. **Decision Making**:
   - Given the historical consistency and zero regret associated with O-L-R-D, continuing with this choice is sensible.
   - Choosing O-L-D or O-R-D might introduce variability and potential regret due to the dependency on the number of participants.

Based on this step-by-step analysis and considering the current pattern of choices, I would choose **O-L-R-D** for the next round.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make a decision on which route to choose, let's analyze the provided data and consider the behavior of participants in previous rounds, along with the cost implications for each route.

### Analysis of Past Rounds:

1. **Initial Summary:**
   - In Round 1, I chose O-R-D and experienced a regret of 80, indicating a high cost.
   - Switching to O-L-R-D in Round 2 eliminated my regret. 

2. **Consistent Strategy:**
   - From Round 2 to Round 14, consistently choosing O-L-R-D resulted in zero regret.
   - The distribution of choices by other participants shows a strong preference for O-L-R-D.

3. **Observation of Patterns:**
   - In most rounds, all 18 participants, including myself, chose O-L-R-D. 
   - This pattern suggests a consensus that O-L-R-D might be the optimal route among the available options.

### Cost Considerations:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost is dependent on the number of participants choosing O-L: \(10 \times X + 210\).
   - Historically, this route has been chosen rarely, indicating potential for high individual costs unless the number of participants is low.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - The cost for this route is determined solely by segment O-L, i.e., \(10 \times X + 0\).
   - Given the fixed cost of 0 for segment L-R and apparent consensus, this has consistently minimized regret.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - High initial fixed cost: \(210 + 10Y\).
   - Initial choice in Round 1 resulted in high regret, reinforcing this as the least preferred option historically when more participants choose it.

### Decision:

Based on previous consistency, lack of regret, and group consensus, the optimal strategy seems to be continuing with the route O-L-R-D.

Thus, for the next round, I will choose:

- **Route: O-L-R-D**

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: Given the history of your choices and the outcomes over the previous 15 rounds, let's analyze the situation systematically:

1. **Review of Past Choices and Regret:**
   - In Round 1, you chose `O-R-D` and experienced regret due to high costs compared to `O-L-R-D`.
   - From Rounds 2 to 15, you consistently chose `O-L-R-D` and experienced no regret, indicating it likely had the lowest cost versus alternatives during these periods.

2. **Understanding Route Costs:**
   - **Route `O-L-D`:** Cost = \(10 \times X + 210\)
   - **Route `O-L-R-D`:** Cost = \(10 \times X + 0 + 10 \times Y\)
   - **Route `O-R-D`:** Cost = \(210 + 10 \times Y\)

3. **Observation of Route Distribution:**
   - Historically, the majority of drivers (including you) have been choosing the `O-L-R-D` route.
   - This pattern suggests a preference for `O-L-R-D`, possibly because it minimizes costs when the number of drivers on segment `O-L` and segment `R-D` are more densely populated.

4. **Analysis of Regret:**
   - There have been no regrets reported from Rounds 2 to 15, which coincides with you continuously selecting `O-L-R-D`.

5. **Future Decision Consideration:**
   - Given your consistent lack of regret with the `O-L-R-D` route choice, and observing the route distribution, it implies this route remains optimal.
   - If there’s no observed shift in others’ strategies, continuing the current pattern aligns with minimizing your cost.

**Conclusion:**
To maintain minimal travel costs given the pattern of previous rounds and assuming others' behavior remains similar, it is rational to continue choosing `O-L-R-D`.

    Your Regret: 0

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make a decision, let's evaluate the information given for the previous rounds and consider which choice to make for this round in order to maximize payoff:

1. **Understanding the Costs**: 
   - The cost for route O-L-D = 10X + 210
   - The cost for route O-L-R-D = 10X + 0 + 10Y
   - The cost for route O-R-D = 210 + 10Y

2. **Review Past Choices**:
   - Your initial choice of **O-R-D** in Round 1 resulted in a regret of 80 due to high costs (since 6 drivers used it, cost was 210 + 60 = 270).
   - Switching to **O-L-R-D** from Round 2 onwards resulted in Zero Regret consistently, even as the number of drivers on this route increased to the maximum of 18 by later rounds. The cost structure of 10X for O-L-R-D when X (total drivers) equals 18 results in the lowest cost of zero regret.

3. **Strategy for Minimizing Cost**:
   - Continue choosing **O-L-R-D**. This route has demonstrated consistent performance with zero regret over multiple rounds, even with all drivers choosing it, implying it remains optimal when the entire group chooses this route simultaneously.

4. **Decision Making**: 
   - Given the data pattern and previous regret-free outcomes with O-L-R-D, action dictated by trying it again becomes rational. Historical data suggests that this route is currently optimized for collective traffic behavior in the experiment setup.

Therefore, based on past rounds and the current context, the choice for this round should be **O-L-R-D**.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make the decision for the next round, let's analyze the data and consider the best strategy from the available options ('O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D'):

1. **Reviewing Past Performance:**
   - You have consistently chosen 'O-L-R-D' from round 2 to 17 and experienced no regret, indicating that it has been a cost-effective choice given the choices of others.
   - In round 1, choosing 'O-R-D' resulted in a regret of 80, suggesting it was not a favorable choice due to relatively high congestion or cost.

2. **Understanding Route Costs:**
   - 'O-L-D' and 'O-R-D' have cost components that depend on the number of drivers choosing these routes.
   - 'O-L-R-D' seems to have a fixed cost (at least based on the historical data), as you experienced zero regrets implying that this route consistently resulted in the lowest costs or at least tied for the lowest cost whenever you and others chose it.

3. **Analyzing Route Choice Distribution:**
   - Everyone has been choosing 'O-L-R-D' for many consecutive rounds (rounds 6 to 17), which indicates a potential Nash equilibrium where no driver benefits from unilaterally changing their route given the others' choices.
   - Changing routes now might increase your personal cost if it deviates significantly from what others choose, causing a mismatch in predicted vs. actual traffic.

4. **Predicting Other Participants' Choices:**
   - Based on historical behavior, it is highly probable that other drivers will continue to choose 'O-L-R-D', given the equilibrium established. Expect inertia or stability in their choice.

5. **Strategy Moving Forward:**
   - It seems rational to continue using 'O-L-R-D' unless significant evidence or incentive suggests others will change their decision.
   - As no new information has been provided that would incentivize a switch, it is strategic to stick with 'O-L-R-D'.

Based on this analysis, the optimal choice for the upcoming round is likely to remain 'O-L-R-D'. This choice minimizes the potential for regret and follows the successful pattern seen in previous rounds.

    Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-R-D': 18}
    Your Regret: 0

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: Step 1: Review Past Performance  
From the summary of the previous rounds, it appears that:
- In Round 1, the choice of route O-R-D led to a regret of 80, indicating a higher cost compared to the other routes.
- From Round 2 to Round 18, the choice of route O-L-R-D consistently resulted in zero regret, suggesting it was the optimal or at least a satisfactory route in each of those rounds.

Step 2: Analyze Distribution Choices  
- From Round 2 to Round 18, the distribution of choices heavily favored the route O-L-R-D, where all 18 participants eventually chose this route consistently.
- The consistent zero regret across these rounds further reinforces the viability of O-L-R-D as an optimal choice given the current trend in selections by all drivers.

Step 3: Cost Analysis  
- Route O-L-D involves two segments with a dynamic cost on O-L and a fixed cost on L-D.
- Route O-L-R-D involves a dynamic cost on O-L and a fixed cost on L-R (which is zero).
- Route O-R-D starts with a fixed cost on O-R and involves a dynamic cost on R-D.

Given the previous trend:
- O-L-R-D avoids the high dynamic cost encountered in R-D on the route O-R-D.
- Also, since all 18 participants have chosen O-L-R-D consistently, the other routes are rarely picked, implying significantly higher costs if diverged from the majority.

Step 4: Strategic Consideration  
- The collective choice of O-L-R-D indicates a successful coordination among participants to minimize overall costs.
- Any deviation from this strategy might lead to higher costs and added regret.

Given these points, it seems rational to continue choosing the route O-L-R-D, as it has consistently resulted in zero regret and optimal costs based on the collective behavior of all the players.

1. **Understanding the Cost Functions:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** Cost = 10X + 210 (where X is the number of drivers on segment O-L)
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y (where X is the number of drivers on segment O-L and Y is the number of drivers on segment R-D)
   - **Route O-R-D:** Cost = 210 + 10Y (where Y is the number of drivers on segment R-D)

2. **Past Performance and Regret:**
   - In Round 1, choosing O-R-D resulted in regret due to higher costs.
   - From Rounds 2 to 19, choosing O-L-R-D consistently resulted in 0 regret, indicating it was the optimal choice given the route distributions.

3. **Route Choice Distribution Insights:**
   - In the majority of recent rounds (from 2 to 19), all 18 drivers have opted for O-L-R-D.
   - The choice of O-L-R-D seems to balance the load on segments O-L and R-D effectively, keeping costs lower than other routes.

4. **Predictive Analysis:**
   - Given the trend in recent rounds where everyone seems to choose O-L-R-D, it is likely that the cost for this route remains the lowest due to its distribution dynamics.
   - Switching to O-L-D or O-R-D could increase costs given that these routes have historically led to higher costs or regret when deviated from O-L-R-D.

5. **Decision:**
   - Continuing to choose O-L-R-D has ensured 0 regret consistently, implying it minimizes travel cost effectively.
   - All participants have settled into a routine that optimally balances traffic, preventing congestion on segments O-L and R-D.
   - Deviating would likely result in increased costs due to lack of balance and potential congestion.

Based on this analysis, continuing to choose route O-L-R-D remains the rational decision for minimizing costs and maximizing payoff.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make an informed decision for the next round, let's analyze the data and make a rational choice.

1. **Route Options**: 
   - O-L-D
   - O-L-R-D
   - O-R-D

2. **Past Performance**:
   - Initially (Round 1), choosing O-R-D resulted in regret of 80. This high regret suggests O-R-D may not be optimal if many participants choose it due to higher variable costs.
   - Moving forward from Round 2, switching to O-L-R-D consistently resulted in zero regret.

3. **Observation**:
   - From rounds 2 to 20, the choice of O-L-R-D has consistently incurred zero regret, even when all participants chose this route in several rounds.

4. **Reasoning**:
   - **O-L-D**: This route was chosen rarely, and when it was, the participants faced other routes being more favorable (likely due to distribution).
   - **O-R-D**: Has variable costs depending on usage, which can lead to higher costs if many participants choose this route.
   - **O-L-R-D**: For the past several rounds, this has been the dominant strategy with minimal competition-related cost increase. A consistent choice by all participants.

5. **Strategy**:
   - The zero regret when choosing O-L-R-D across most rounds indicates a stable environment where this route consistently provides a favorable payoff likely due to lower competitive pressure or balanced fixed/variable costs.
   - Deviating from O-L-R-D without a specific reason (such as observed change in other participants' behavior) might increase the risk of higher costs/regret.

Based on the above analysis, continuing to choose the route **O-L-R-D** appears the best strategy to minimize costs and avoid regret, given recent consistent performance and absence of variable cost surprises. 

With this decision in mind, the output should be:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}

    Your Regret: 0

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: Given your past performance and regret values, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Costs**:
   - For route O-L-D: Cost = 10X (O-L) + 210 (L-D).
   - For route O-L-R-D: Cost is fixed at 0 for segment L-R.
   - For route O-R-D: Cost = 210 (O-R) + 10Y (R-D).

2. **Regret Analysis**:
   - You had high regret when choosing O-R-D in Round 1 because of higher travel costs. This suggests O-R-D is not optimal when several participants choose it.
   - All subsequent rounds where you chose route O-L-R-D resulted in zero regret, indicating that this route cost you the least compared to others.

3. **Historical Route Distribution**:
   - The majority of participants, including you, have been consistently choosing O-L-R-D from Round 2 onwards.
   - The strategy seems to be stable and successful since you're achieving a minimum regret of 0 each round.

4. **Evaluation of Alternatives**:
   - The route O-L-D was chosen only once in Round 2, indicating potential overcrowding should more participants decide to switch.
   - O-R-D resulted in the highest regret for you due to costs increasing with more drivers.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that the route O-L-R-D has consistently led to zero regret and appears to be a stable strategy, it's advisable to continue with this choice.
   - There is no indication from the data that a sudden shift in choices (e.g., many drivers switching to O-L-D or O-R-D) is likely, so the O-L-R-D route remains optimal.

Based on this analysis, the choice for the next round should be route O-L-R-D.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make a well-informed decision for the next round, let's evaluate the previous rounds and the given options:

1. **Current Situation Observations:**
   - In the initial rounds, 'O-L-R-D' was chosen by most participants, resulting in a regret of 0 from the second round onwards.
   - Historically, no regret is associated with the choice of 'O-L-R-D', implying it either offers the minimum cost or is competitive with any alternatives.

2. **Cost Analysis:**
   - **O-L-D:** This route's cost is influenced by the number of participants on the O-L segment, with a fixed cost of 210 for the L-D segment. High regret was noted the first round it was chosen by any participant, suggesting a potentially higher average cost when multiple drivers select the first segment.
   
   - **O-L-R-D:** This has been consistently selected by all participants except in the first few rounds, and has resulted in zero regret. It involves segments where variable costs occur but is apparently balanced by the zero cost segment between L-R.
   
   - **O-R-D:** This route has a fixed 210 cost from O-R and a variable cost from R-D. In the first round, it came with high regret, likely due to the variable cost of R-D when many participants chose this route.

3. **Strategic Choice:**
   - From round 2 onwards, when 'O-L-R-D' became the dominant strategy with no encountered regret, participants stuck with it.
   - Considering the pattern, choosing 'O-L-R-D' continues to seem the most risk-averse option, optimizing cost without regret according to the given historical performance.

Considering the observations and analysis, the logical choice to optimize the cost based on historical data is to continue with 'O-L-R-D'.

    Your Regret: 0

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To determine the best route choice for the next round, let’s evaluate the available options, considering the previous results:

1. **Route O-L-D**:
    - Cost = 10X + 210
    - This route has been chosen very infrequently in the previous rounds. The only times it has appeared were when 1 or 2 drivers chose it, which results in relatively high costs for those drivers involved (because X becomes small when few people are on this path, resulting in a potentially low total cost compared to the others if many drivers switch). 

2. **Route O-L-R-D**:
    - Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y
    - In the past rounds, this route is being consistently chosen by all 18 drivers. Since all 18 participants have been using it, the cost distribution is fairly distributed and predictable. Given previous outcomes where the regret was consistently 0, it indicates this option might put agents in a risk-neutral position. 

3. **Route O-R-D**:
    - Cost = 210 + 10Y
    - This route experienced a high number of participants in the first round, leading to a high personal cost (and regret of 80), discouraging further use. As a result, players shifted away from this route to O-L-R-D, assuming Y became too large, resulting in substantially higher costs.

### Decision Making:
Here’s the step-by-step logic leading to the decision:

- **Analysis of Risk and Predictability**: "O-L-R-D" has been chosen consistently by all players for many rounds without regrets, which makes it a very safe and predictable option. Predictability minimizes substantial negative outcomes (i.e., high costs), which appears to be the collective strategy.

- **Consideration of Potential Shifts**: If others choose to experiment with switching routes, it could either decrease congestion on "O-L-R-D" or demonstrate changing patterns. However, deviating from a risk-neutral position without clear signals could risk higher costs.

- **Potential Cost**: Given all participants choose "O-L-R-D", the travel cost remains consistent for each, minimizing regret compared to other options.

Given the past rounds have shown zero regret and consistent outcomes using "O-L-R-D", it makes the most sense to maintain this route choice to continue minimizing risk of higher travel costs.

Thus, the recommended route for the next round is `O-L-R-D`.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make an informed decision, let's break down the situation based on the previous rounds and potential costs associated with each route.

### Analyzing Previous Rounds:
1. **Choice Stability**:
   - From Round 2 to Round 24, the consistent choice has been 'O-L-R-D' with no regret. The distribution suggests all 18 participants are also choosing 'O-L-R-D'.
   
2. **Costs and Regret**:
   - Regret is defined as the difference between the cost incurred and the minimum possible cost. Consistently choosing 'O-L-R-D' for many rounds has resulted in zero regret.
   - In Round 1, choosing 'O-R-D' incurred a regret of 80, indicating it was not the minimal cost option. Switching was beneficial.

### Cost Analysis:
1. **Route O-L-D**:
   - \( \text{Cost} = 10X + 210 \)
   - Given the past rounds have not included anyone choosing this option, X would be 1 initially if chosen alone. Potential shifts in others' choices could rapidly increase X, leading to uncertain outcomes.

2. **Route O-L-R-D**:
   - \( \text{Cost} = 10X + 0 + 10Y \)
   - Since all choose this route, X = Y = 18.
   - Cost \((10 \times 18) + (10 \times 18) = 360\).
   - Subtracting 360 from the 400 points endowment leads to a payoff of 40, higher than any untested alternative without data showing improvement.

3. **Route O-R-D**:
   - \(\text{Cost} = 210 + 10Y\)
   - For Y = 2 in past rounds, it would have resulted in 230.
   - However, the trend heavily discourages switch based on consistent participant behavior leaning towards minimal cost strategies in 'O-L-R-D'.

### Conclusion and Decision:
Considering the significant number of rounds showing stability in choice and the zero regret associated with 'O-L-R-D', while both participants and segments maintain equilibrium in costs and distribution: 

**Current Optimal Choice: 'O-L-R-D'**

    Your Regret: 0

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make a decision on which route to choose, let's analyze the information from previous rounds as well as the cost structure.

1. **Historical Route Choices and Costs:**
   - From Round 2 to Round 25, I've consistently chosen the route 'O-L-R-D' and incurred zero regret.
   - During these rounds, all 18 participants, including myself, chose the 'O-L-R-D' route.
   - This suggests that 'O-L-R-D' was the optimal route as any deviation from it did not happen and resulted in zero regret, which means the cost could not be lowered by choosing a different route.

2. **Cost Analysis of Each Route:**
   - **O-L-D Route:**
     - Cost is \(10X + 210\).
     - If more participants choose this route, 'X' increases, and thus the cost might be high.
   - **O-L-R-D Route:**
     - Cost is \(10X + 0 + 10Y\).
     - In recent rounds, the cost for this route was minimized because everyone chose it, distributing the cost evenly.
   - **O-R-D Route:**
     - Cost is \(210 + 10Y\).
     - In earlier rounds (except for Round 1), this route wasn't popular due to higher costs of individual \('Y'\) if fewer participants chose it.

3. **Strategic Consideration:**
   - Continuing to choose 'O-L-R-D' has consistently been a rational decision due to its low-cost outcome when all participants chose it.
   - If I deviate from the crowd, my travel cost on 'O-L-D' or 'O-R-D' might increase dramatically due to the formulae used for cost calculation involving the number of users ('X' or 'Y').

4. **Game Dynamics:**
   - Players seem to have reached a stable equilibrium by repeatedly choosing 'O-L-R-D' without regret, suggesting it's the collectively best choice thus far.
   - There's no indication that other players are aware or ready to shift from this equilibrium in sudden rounds without any external events or incentives.

5. **Decision:**
   - Based on the consistent no-regret strategy and the stable route equilibrium of the group, I should continue choosing 'O-L-R-D'.

Therefore, my choice would be:

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make a decision for the next route selection, let's analyze the summary of the previous rounds:

1. **Initial Regret for O-R-D in Round 1:**
   - In Round 1, choosing O-R-D led to a regret of 80 due to the relatively high cost when shared with 6 users, while 12 users shared O-L-R-D. This suggests that initially, O-L-R-D was the less costly route due to more users sharing the cost.

2. **Success with O-L-R-D in Subsequent Rounds:**
   - From Round 2 onwards, switching to O-L-R-D has consistently resulted in zero regret. This indicates that O-L-R-D has been an optimal choice with costs minimized by sharing with all 18 drivers. 

3. **Stable Route Distribution:**
   - The route distribution has stabilized with all participants consistently choosing O-L-R-D, indicating a collective equilibrium minimizing individual travel costs. 
   
4. **Risk of Switching:**
   - Changing routes could lead to higher individual costs, as seen with the initial choice of O-R-D. O-L-D has rarely been chosen, indicating higher potential risks if the choice leads to fewer participants sharing that route.

Given the stable equilibrium and the observed zero regret resulting from repeatedly selecting O-L-R-D, along with the expectation that other drivers will maintain their current choice to avoid increased personal costs, the optimal decision is to continue choosing O-L-R-D.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make an informed decision, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Review Past Choices and Costs:**
   - In Round 1, you chose `O-R-D`, and it resulted in a regret of 80. This indicates that the decision led to a higher cost than other possible choices, suggesting it might not be the most efficient route due to high traffic or cost.
   - From Rounds 2 to 27, consistently choosing `O-L-R-D` resulted in zero regret, meaning it was either the optimal choice or equally efficient compared to other routes.

2. **Current Traffic Distribution:**
   - The distribution over the past several rounds shows all 18 participants have consistently chosen `O-L-R-D`.
   - This concentration suggests `O-L-R-D` is stable regarding costs, possibly due to the zero-cost segment `L-R` and better distribution of traffic that keeps individual costs low.

3. **Potential Strategies:**
   - Stick with `O-L-R-D`: Given its history of zero regrets, choosing `O-L-R-D` continues to be a safe choice if the traffic pattern holds steady. It suggests a balanced route with the minimal cost impact from variable segments due to all players moving in sync.
   - Consider Route Change: If there are signs or predictions (e.g., communication with other players) that a shift might occur, it could make sense to reassess. However, from the past information and the absence of external analysis, there is no immediate suggestion for a drastic change.

4. **Decision-making:**
   - Given the consistent past results and our aim to minimize costs with zero regrets, `O-L-R-D` appears to be the most rational choice based on historical performance and current distribution understanding among participants.

Therefore, my decision based on this analysis is to continue choosing the route `O-L-R-D`. Here is the JSON output reflecting that choice:

    Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-R-D': 18}
    Your Regret: 0

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make a decision on the route to choose, we need to analyze the situation based on past rounds and the potential costs associated with each route. Our goal is to minimize the travel cost and thus maximize the payoff.

1. **Reviewing Past Rounds:**
   - Starting from round 2 onwards, choosing route 'O-L-R-D' where everyone else made the same choice has consistently resulted in zero regret. This means our choice was optimal, given the choices of others.
   - No other combination of choices or alternative routes in previous rounds seemed to have provided a better payoff than the current dominant choice of 'O-L-R-D'.

2. **Understanding Cost Functions:**
   - Route `O-L-D`: Cost = 10X + 210
   - Route `O-L-R-D`: Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y
   - Route `O-R-D`: Cost = 210 + 10Y

   Here:
   - X = number of drivers on segment O-L for `O-L-D` and `O-L-R-D`.
   - Y = number of drivers on segment R-D for `O-L-R-D` and `O-R-D`.

3. **Analyzing Current Situation:**
   - Given that all participants have been choosing 'O-L-R-D' in recent rounds, changing the choice to another route like 'O-R-D' or 'O-L-D' might lead to higher costs when others do not follow the same change.
   - Switching routes could result in increased costs due to more drivers on segments O-R and L-D individually incurring fixed costs or adding to segment R-D congestion.

4. **Risk Assessment:**
   - In traffic network games like this, players reaching a Nash equilibrium often do not deviate unless they anticipate others will change their strategies as well.
   - Changing routes now might only make sense if there were signals that others are also going to deviate from 'O-L-R-D', as observed in round 1 which resulted in regret.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given no new information or indication of others changing their strategy, sticking with 'O-L-R-D' remains the most risk-averse choice and is most likely to provide zero regret.

Based on this analysis, continuing to choose **'O-L-R-D'** is the safest strategy.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To decide on the best route for the next round, let's analyze the past data step by step:

1. **Review of Past Choices and Outcomes:**
   - For round 1, you chose the route **O-R-D** and experienced regret because the number of drivers on the segment R-D was high, resulting in high costs.
   - From round 2 onwards, you switched to route **O-L-R-D** and maintained this choice consistently.
   - Since round 2, all participants but one have chosen O-L-R-D, and this choice led to zero regret.
   - The distribution of routes in rounds 6 through 29 indicates that all 18 participants consistently chose the route O-L-R-D.

2. **Cost Calculation for Each Route Given Full O-L-R-D Adoption:**
   - **O-L-D**: Cost would be 10X + 210. If no one switches, X would be zero, but it's unpredictable without data on others choosing O-L-D.
   - **O-L-R-D**: Cost is consistent. Since everyone has consistently chosen this route, the cost calculation is predictable and matches past outcomes.
   - **O-R-D**: Cost is 210 + 10Y. Historically, choosing O-R-D led to high costs when more participants chose it.

3. **Risk Assessment:**
   - **O-L-D**: This route has not been popular, with only isolated occurrences. Choosing it could lead to unpredictable costs unless other drivers suddenly change.
   - **O-L-R-D**: This route has been reliable, leading to minimal costs and zero regret for multiple consecutive rounds.
   - **O-R-D**: Historically resulted in regrettably high costs in early rounds.

4. **Optimal Decision:**
   - Observing the consistent strategy among all participants, continuing with **O-L-R-D** appears optimal as it has minimized costs and resulted in no regret for the last 28 rounds.
   - There's no indication from the past rounds that other participants would change their strategy, thus maintaining the low-cost advantage of O-L-R-D.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Stick with the route **O-L-R-D**, based on past performance and stability provided by the consistent choice of all participants.

Based on this analysis, the decision is:

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make a decision regarding route selection, we should analyze past performance and current trends. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the decision-making process:

1. **Previous Choices and Costs:**
   - In Round 1, the choice was "O-R-D" with a regret of 80.
   - From Rounds 2 to 30, the choice was "O-L-R-D" with a consistent regret of 0.
   
This indicates that "O-L-R-D" is a consistently cost-effective choice with no regret over 29 consecutive rounds.

2. **Route Choice Distribution:**
   - Rounds 3-30 show a strong preference among all participants for the route "O-L-R-D." 
   - In almost every round, all 18 participants have chosen the route "O-L-R-D."
   
This suggests that based on the decisions of others, they have also found this route to be optimal in terms of cost.

3. **Regret Analysis:**
   - Regret is a measure of perceived loss; the lower the regret, the better the decision in hindsight.
   - With a consistent regret of 0 for "O-L-R-D," this indicates great satisfaction with this choice in creating a cost-effective path.

4. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Choosing other routes like "O-L-D" or "O-R-D" might increase regret, as seen in Round 1.
   - Historical data shows that deviating from "O-L-R-D" has resulted in higher costs.

Given these considerations, it is evident that "O-L-R-D" remains a dominant strategy. Given the lack of any change in regret or strategy among participants, there is no incentive to switch routes.

Thus, the optimal decision for the next round is to choose the route "O-L-R-D." Below is the JSON formatted output for this decision:

```json

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: Given the information from the previous rounds, let me go through a step-by-step decision-making process:

1. **Review Historical Choices and Regret**: 
   - In Round 1, you chose route O-R-D and experienced regret, indicating it was not optimal.
   - From Round 2 onwards, you consistently chose route O-L-R-D. This choice always resulted in 0 regret, suggesting that it has been optimal in all subsequent rounds.

2. **Analyze the Distribution**:
   - The distribution in Round 2 showed that most players (17 out of 18) chose O-L-R-D, and this has been a recurring pattern. By Round 6, all participants were choosing O-L-R-D.
   - No other choices have been made since Round 6, indicating a strong consensus among all participants to choose O-L-R-D.

3. **Consider the Cost Function**:
   - Route O-L-R-D has a cost that solely depends on the traffic on O-L, which is shared by all drivers. Given that all 18 drivers are choosing this route, it minimizes extra costs associated with route variations.
   - There is no shift in chosen routes, suggesting the collective strategy remains unchanged, likely minimizing everyone's average cost.

4. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Trying a different route (O-L-D or O-R-D) may result in increased cost given the full adoption of the O-L-R-D route by other participants. Any deviation without indication of a shift by others could increase personal travel costs due to non-shared segments.
   - Since there's stability in choices and the absence of regret, staying with the current strategy provides the least risk.

**Decision**: Given the consistent lack of regret and absolute alignment in other participants' choices, the most rational decision is to continue choosing route O-L-R-D.

    Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-R-D': 18}
    Your Regret: 0

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To decide which route to take, let's first analyze the situation based on the past rounds:

1. **Previous Choices and Regret:**
   - You've been consistently choosing the route 'O-L-R-D' from Round 2 to Round 32, except for the first round.
   - In the initial choice (`Round 1`), you picked 'O-R-D' and experienced a regret of 80.
   - From `Round 2` onwards, you've experienced zero regrets by sticking to 'O-L-R-D'.

2. **Route Choice Distributions:**
   - In Round 1, the choice distribution was split more between 'O-R-D' and 'O-L-R-D'. 
   - Starting from Round 2 and onward, 'O-L-R-D' has been chosen consistently by either nearly all or all drivers.

3. **Cost Considerations:**
   - Route 'O-R-D' involves a fixed cost of 210 at segment O-R and a variable cost at segment R-D. Your experience in Round 1 showed this route can incur high costs if others also choose R-D.
   - Route 'O-L-D' involves a variable cost at O-L plus a fixed 210 at L-D. The distribution shows this route is rarely chosen, indicating potential high costs if attempted unilaterally without knowledge of future choices.
   - Route 'O-L-R-D' has been optimal for you, consistently yielding zero regrets, suggesting that this has been the least costly choice given the distribution.

4. **Strategy Moving Forward:**
   - Given the consistent pattern and the absence of regrets, switching the route might introduce unpredictability and potential regrets.
   - The absence of change in choices indicates stability and minimization of cost that has worked well.

Given these considerations, the rational decision would be to persist with the choice of route 'O-L-R-D'.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To determine the optimal route choice for the upcoming round, we need to analyze the previous rounds and the dynamics of the costs involved.

1. **Review Past Performance**:
   - You initially tried route O-R-D in Round 1 and experienced regret due to higher costs. The cost calculation in a crowded R-D segment demonstrated that this choice involves higher risks when multiple drivers select it.
   - From Round 2 onwards, you switched to O-L-R-D and have consistently experienced zero regret. This indicates that this route has reliably provided lower or acceptable costs compared to your initial choice.

2. **Consistency and Collaborative Behavior**:
   - The distribution shows overwhelming preference for O-L-R-D by all participants from Round 2 onward. This consistent choice indicates a collaborative equilibrium where the costs are predictable and generally minimized for everyone.
   - In recent rounds, a repetitive choice of O-L-R-D by all 18 drivers resulted in zero regret, confirming that players trust this strategy to minimize individual costs.

3. **Cost Calculations**:
   - Route O-L-R-D has fixed costs on segments O-L and no variable cost on segment L-R, mitigating the likelihood of high variability in costs.
   - Routes involving segments with costs depending on other participants, such as O-R-D and O-L-D, could potentially expose you to higher costs if congestion occurs unexpectedly. Specifically, the segment calculations for O-L-D and O-R-D are dependent on the weight players place on these segments at any given round, making them less predictable.

4. **Future Play Strategy**:
   - Emphasizing stability, predictability, zero regret, and historical data, selecting O-L-R-D appears to be the most sensible choice. Changing your strategy risks deviating from the established collaborative equilibrium that has worked without regret thus far.

Therefore, to maximize payoff and maintain zero regret, the logical choice for the next round is:

    Your Regret: 0

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Review Route Options and Costs:**
   - The available routes are O-L-D, O-L-R-D, and O-R-D.
   - For each segment, we have:
     - O-L: Cost is 10 * number of drivers on this segment.
     - L-D: Fixed cost is 210.
     - L-R: Fixed cost is 0.
     - R-D: Cost is 10 * number of drivers on this segment.
     - O-R: Fixed cost is 210.

2. **Review Past Choices and Outcomes:**
   - In round 1, choosing route O-R-D resulted in regret due to high cost.
   - From rounds 2 to 34, choosing O-L-R-D resulted in 0 regret and a stable choice distribution where most, if not all, drivers chose this route.

3. **Evaluate Stability and Payoffs:**
   - Consistent zero regrets suggest that O-L-R-D is a stable choice with a favorable cost-benefit outcome.
   - Zero regret implies that given the distribution, O-L-R-D has effectively managed congestion and cost to personal advantage.

4. **Predict Likely Behavior of Other Drivers:**
   - Given the historical pattern, it is highly probable that most drivers will continue selecting O-L-R-D, preserving low individual costs and aligning with stable network behavior.

5. **Consider Potential Changes:**
   - There was a brief deviation in round 33 with one driver choosing O-R-D, otherwise, stability has been maintained.
   - Introducing further variation by switching routes now could increase personal cost due to expected congestion on alternate routes or lead to unpredicted outcomes.

6. **Make a Decision:**
   - To maximize payoff (minimize cost) based on historical data, the rational choice is to continue selecting O-L-R-D unless a significant pattern change in other drivers' choices is observed.

With these considerations in mind, the optimal decision given the information is:

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: Given your past decisions and outcomes, here’s a structured breakdown of the situation to determine an optimal route choice for the upcoming round:

1. **Historical Performance:**
   - You initially chose the route 'O-R-D' in Round 1 and faced significant regret due to high costs with 6 choosing this segment.
   - From Round 2 onwards, shifting to 'O-L-R-D' eliminated your regrets consistently, indicating it has consistently minimized your costs compared to other routes over the rounds.

2. **Route Analysis:**
   - **O-L-D**: This route has a cost of \(10X + 210\). Historically, it hasn't been a common choice (only once chosen by one driver each in some rounds), implying potential mass avoidance due to higher perceived costs.
   - **O-R-D**: This route has fixed and variable parts amounting to 210 + \(10Y\). Initially, this was costly due to the number of drivers, and only saw uptake again very recently by a single driver which suggests a sporadic experimentation rather than a viable low-cost option.
   - **O-L-R-D**: The costs here are determined by 10X on the O-L part and 10Y on the R-D part, equating to 10 drivers on both paths. Since 18 drivers have repeatedly opted for this route, its appeal must lie in balance: effectively moderate, predictable costs.

3. **Strategic Position:**
   - With practically zero regrets and a consistent pattern of sticking with 'O-L-R-D', it infers that collectively the drivers have found a relative equilibrium where no one's compelled to deviate due to disproportionate costs.

4. **Decision Rationalization:**
   - Given the symmetric past outcomes and resultant zero regret history with 'O-L-R-D', rationality suggests that strategically veering from this would require a strong incentive or signal that other routes would provide a lower cost, which historically isn’t evident.
   
5. **Conclusion:**
   - The best strategy under current circumstances, given the historical consistency and absence of emerging trends suggesting better alternatives, is to continue choosing the route 'O-L-R-D'.

Based on this structured assessment of previous outcomes and prevailing route dynamics, here is your decision:

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: Given the data from the previous rounds, it's important to analyze the trends and outcomes to make an optimal decision for the upcoming rounds. Let's break this down:

1. **Route Choices and Historical Data:**
   - From Rounds 2 to 36, you have consistently chosen the route `O-L-R-D`, except in Round 1.
   - The regret for choosing `O-L-R-D` has been consistently 0 from Round 2 onwards, indicating this route has been the optimal choice based on the choices of others.

2. **Route Distribution:**
   - The majority of participants have predominantly chosen the route `O-L-R-D` since Round 2.
   - Occasionally, 1 or 2 drivers have ventured into other routes like `O-L-D` or `O-R-D`, but these have been rare and did not impact the zero-regret outcome for `O-L-R-D`.

3. **Route Cost Analysis:**
   - Route `O-L-R-D` has a cost formula of (10X + 0 + 10Y), where both `O-L` and `R-D` segments are affected by the choices of participants.
   - It seems participants found a Nash equilibrium where all choose `O-L-R-D`, resulting in the lowest shared cost given the distribution.

4. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - Deviating from `O-L-R-D` could potentially increase your cost and regret if other participants do not change their behavior.
   - Switching to `O-L-D` or `O-R-D` carries a risk if not enough participants make the same switch to lower the number on those routes.
   - Sticking with `O-L-R-D` is backed by empirical success — 0 regret indicates optimal play within the context.

5. **Decision for Current Round:**
   - Given the observed successful pattern of `O-L-R-D` through zero regret and maximizing payoff due to equilibrium, it is logical to continue choosing `O-L-R-D` unless significant changes in opponents' choices are detected.

Conclusively, based on the above considerations and historical outcomes, maintaining the choice of `O-L-R-D` is optimal.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make an informed decision for the next round, let's analyze the previous rounds and determine the best strategy to minimize regret and maximize payoff.

### Analysis of Previous Rounds:
1. **Route Choices and Regret:**
   - In Round 1, you chose O-R-D and had regret of 80. This is likely due to more participants choosing this route, resulting in higher costs because of congestion on the R-D segment.
   - From Round 2 onward, you consistently chose O-L-R-D and experienced zero regret. This suggests that this route was cost-effective given the choices of others.

2. **Traffic Distribution:**
   - From Round 2 through Round 37, the majority of participants consistently picked route O-L-R-D, with an occasional participant selecting a different option (noted in a few rounds).
   - The pattern indicates that other participants also favored the O-L-R-D route, possibly because it minimized their travel costs.

3. **Cost Implications:**
   - The segment costs for O-L-R-D are calculated as \(10 \times X + 0\), where \(X\) is the number of drivers choosing O-L (including you).
   - Since everyone appears to favor this route and it still results in lower total costs for each driver, this suggests that the effective cost of congestion might be balanced or lower than the fixed costs of alternative routes, assuming others stick with their usual choices.

### Decision for the Next Round:
Given the analysis of the previous rounds:
- The consistent choice of O-L-R-D with no regret implies it's a stable equilibrium, where switching routes is unlikely to further reduce your travel costs.
- Based on historical patterns, deviating from O-L-R-D poses a risk of incurring higher costs or regret, especially if others continue to choose O-L-R-D, making alternate routes unfavorable.

Therefore, it would be strategic to continue choosing the route that has consistently resulted in no regret: **O-L-R-D**.

### Conclusion:
Given the above reasoning, my decision for the next round will be:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make a decision on which route to choose, let's analyze the information given from the previous rounds and the traffic network structure:

1. **Route Cost Analysis**: 
    - **O-L-D**: Cost function is \(10X + 210\) where \(X\) is the number of participants choosing this route.
    - **O-L-R-D**: Cost function is \(10X + 0 + 10Y\) where \(X\) is the number of participants choosing segment O-L and \(Y\) for R-D. This does not make a cost difference in itself because all choosing O-L-R-D will drive the exact same segmented path together.
    - **O-R-D**: Cost function is \(210 + 10Y\) where \(Y\) is the number of participants choosing this route, impacting segments O-R and R-D.

2. **Historical Choices Analysis**: 
    - Up till now, you have chosen O-L-R-D from Round 2 to 38 continuously, with no incurred regrets, meaning it was consistently a cost-effective choice. 
    - During initial rounds, deviations from choosing optimal routes such as O-R-D led to regrets (e.g., in Round 1).
    - When all drivers choose O-L-R-D, the cost theoretically remains low as seen from rounds 6-38.

3. **Forecasting Behavior**:
    - History shows that most participants (including you) settled into choosing O-L-R-D after an initial experimentation phase. The pattern of choice, especially in later rounds, shows substantial stability towards O-L-R-D.

4. **Current Decision**:
    - Considering historical data, since the group predominantly selects O-L-R-D and it yielded the least regret consistently, choosing O-L-R-D remains strategically sound.
    - The group dynamics suggest stability in behavior, so no significant cost increases for O-L-R-D are anticipated by changing driver behavior at this stage.

Given the above analysis, for Round 39, the best strategy would be to continue with the route O-L-R-D to maximize payoff and minimize potential regret.

    Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-R-D': 18}
    Your Regret: 0

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.
LLM Output: To make a decision about which route to choose, let's analyze the available options based on past performance and potential costs.

1. **Historical Choices and Costs:**
   - The first round choice of **O-R-D** resulted in a regret of 80, suggesting higher travel costs compared to potential alternatives.
   - Subsequent rounds show consistent use of **O-L-R-D** with no regret in any of those rounds.

2. **Route Analysis:**
   - **O-L-D:** Cost = \(10X + 210\)
   - **O-L-R-D:** Cost = \(10X + 0 + 10Y\) (consistently no additional participants on L-R)
   - **O-R-D:** Cost = \(210 + 10Y\)

3. **Participant Distribution:**
   - For nearly every round since round 2, all participants, including myself, have chosen **O-L-R-D**, resulting in no regrets. This indicates that the cost was minimal and consistent.
   - In rounds where the distribution was exclusively **O-L-R-D**, all participants incurred minimal costs, reinforcing it as the most cost-effective choice based on historical data.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Historical data indicates that **O-L-R-D** is favored by all participants due to its minimal cost implication.
   - Deviating from **O-L-R-D** did not appear to provide any benefit in the past, indicating that it is a safer strategy to follow the majority and stick with what has worked well.

Considering these points, repeating the choice of **O-L-R-D** seems optimal given its consistent performance in terms of cost minimization and absence of regret in the past rounds.
