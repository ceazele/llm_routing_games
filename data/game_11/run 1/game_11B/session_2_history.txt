System Message: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make a strategic decision on which route to choose in the traffic network game, let's analyze each route's potential cost and payoff implications:

1. **Understanding Costs**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: The cost is calculated as \(10X + 210\), where \(X\) is the number of drivers choosing this route.
   - **Route O-R-D**: The cost is \(210 + 10Y\), where \(Y\) is the number of drivers opting for this route.

2. **Initial Endowment**:
   - Every round starts with an endowment of 400 points.
   - Your payoff is the endowment minus your travel cost.

3. **Optimal Strategy Based on Others' Choices**:
   - Ideally, you want to choose the route with the fewest drivers to minimize the variable cost component.
   - If many drivers select route O-L-D, the cost increases due to the congestion cost term \(10X\). Conversely, if many choose O-R-D, the congestion cost \(10Y\) comes into play.
   - In a situation where congestion costs are balanced, the fixed segment costs (210) are the same. Hence, the decision pivots on predicting the congestion cost you'll incur relative to others' decisions.

4. **Decision Strategy**:
   - With symmetrical fixed costs, the decision trickles down to predicting which route fewest others will choose.
   - However, considering both routes have an identical fixed cost structure when total participants are considered, each strategy mirrors the other's cost when an equal number distributes across both.
   - If \((X + Y) = 18\) and assuming initial equal distribution (say 9 choose each), costs balance out. Thus, strategic adjustments after observing initial cost patterns would drive later decisions.

5. **Decision**:
   - In absence of prior rounds' data dictating a clear advantage to any given route and based on initial symmetric assumptions, a random or balanced initial distribution can be leveraged.
   - To begin, selecting route O-R-D could be arbitrary yet balanced considering both costs structures converge when drivers are evenly distributed across both routes.

Given these considerations, I will choose the route O-R-D for this round:

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 14, 'O-L-D': 4}
  Your Regret: 90


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Based on the summary from the previous round, let's evaluate what happened and how to adjust the strategy for the current round:

1. **Review of Previous Round**:
   - **Your Choice**: O-R-D
   - **Distribution**: 14 drivers chose O-R-D, and 4 chose O-L-D.
   - **Cost Calculation for O-R-D**: \(210 + 10 \times 14 = 350\)
   - **Endowment**: 400, leading to a payoff of \(400 - 350 = 50\)
   - **Regret**: 90, indicating that the alternative choice (O-L-D) would have resulted in a lower cost.

2. **Analysis**:
   - The imbalance in route selection led to higher congestion costs for O-R-D.
   - O-L-D had fewer drivers (4), resulting in a lower congestion cost of \(10 \times 4 = 40\), plus the fixed 210: totaling \(40 + 210 = 250\).
   - Your regret of 90 suggests that choosing O-L-D (250 points) would have saved 90 points compared to your cost of 350 by choosing O-R-D.

3. **Strategic Adjustment**:
   - To minimize costs and maximize payoff, it is beneficial to select the route with fewer drivers.
   - Given the previous pattern where a majority chose O-R-D, revising to O-L-D may be cost-effective if rivals repeat their choices.
   - Exploit the likelihood of others sticking to their previous choices, since it often happens in such games with repetitive patterns.

4. **Decision for this Round**:
   - Opt for route **O-L-D** to capitalize on potentially lower congestion costs. This accounts for the observed heavy traffic on O-R-D.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 2.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 17, 'O-R-D': 1}
  Your Regret: 150


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's review the summary from the previous round and decide on a strategy for the current round:

1. **Previous Round Summary**:
   - **Your Choice**: O-L-D
   - **Distribution**: 17 drivers chose O-L-D, and 1 chose O-R-D.
   - **Cost Calculation for O-L-D**: \(10 \times 17 + 210 = 380\)
   - **Endowment**: 400, leading to a payoff of \(400 - 380 = 20\)
   - **Regret**: 150, indicating that choosing the alternative route (O-R-D) would have significantly reduced costs.

2. **Analysis**:
   - The majority of drivers chose O-L-D, greatly increasing the congestion cost.
   - With only 1 person choosing O-R-D, the cost for that route was \(210 + 10 \times 1 = 220\).
   - The regret indicates that choosing O-R-D would have saved 150 points compared to the choice of O-L-D.

3. **Strategic Adjustment**:
   - There's a tendency for players to avoid repeating their mistakes. Given the heavy congestion on O-L-D previously, it's likely that drivers may reconsider their choice.
   - Potential for a swing from O-L-D to O-R-D given high previous regret, but initially assume adjustments may be slow.
   - Vary your approach by choosing O-R-D, anticipation of reduced congestion on the previously less favored route.

4. **Decision for this Round**:
   - Opt for route **O-R-D** to capitalize on potentially lower congestion, anticipating a shift in driver choices from O-L-D to balance out.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 2.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 17, 'O-L-D': 1}
  Your Regret: 150


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the summary from the previous round, let's analyze the situation and make a decision:

1. **Previous Round Summary**:
   - **Your Choice**: O-R-D
   - **Distribution**: 17 drivers chose O-R-D, and 1 chose O-L-D.
   - **Cost Calculation for O-R-D**: \(210 + 10 \times 17 = 380\)
   - **Endowment**: 400, leading to a payoff of \(400 - 380 = 20\)
   - **Regret**: 150, suggesting that choosing O-L-D would have significantly reduced costs.

2. **Analysis**:
   - The overwhelming majority chose O-R-D, leading to a high congestion cost.
   - Only 1 driver chose O-L-D, making the cost on that route \(10 \times 1 + 210 = 220\).
   - The regret indicates selecting O-L-D would have been far more cost-effective.

3. **Strategic Adjustment**:
   - Players generally react to regret by shifting their choices. Given that most suffered high costs with O-R-D, a switch to O-L-D can be expected.
   - Anticipate a major shift of drivers from O-R-D to O-L-D in response to the outcome of the previous round.
   - Choosing O-R-D can now potentially result in lower congestion if many players switch away from it.

4. **Decision for this Round**:
   - Opt for route **O-L-D** assuming that a large portion might still slowly adjust, but the congestion might now be more balanced if not too extreme.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
  Your Regret: 130


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the conditions and the outcome of the previous round, let's carefully reconsider the approach and make a strategic decision:

1. **Previous Round Summary**:
   - **Your Choice**: O-L-D
   - **Distribution**: 16 drivers chose O-L-D, and 2 chose O-R-D.
   - **Cost Calculation for O-L-D**: \(10 \times 16 + 210 = 370\)
   - **Endowment**: 400, leading to a payoff of \(400 - 370 = 30\)
   - **Regret**: 130, suggesting that choosing O-R-D would have reduced costs significantly.

2. **Analysis**:
   - A majority of drivers continue to select O-L-D, resulting in high congestion costs.
   - With only 2 drivers choosing O-R-D, the cost for that route was \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 230\).
   - The regret indicates that choosing O-R-D would have resulted in a much better payoff.

3. **Strategic Adjustment**:
   - Players are likely responding slowly to shifts in costs. However, there is a pattern where many are staying with O-L-D despite high costs.
   - Anticipate further adjustment with more drivers potentially switching to O-R-D due to observed regret.
   - Opting again for O-R-D seems a strategic move to potentially capture the lower congestion rewards if more drivers continue to linger on O-L-D.

4. **Decision for this Round**:
   - Choose route **O-R-D**, expecting a potential balance shift where it remains less congested than O-L-D, thus offering a lower travel cost.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 16, 'O-L-D': 2}
  Your Regret: 130


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Based on the information from the previous rounds and the current context, let's work through the decision-making process:

1. **Previous Round Summary**:
   - **Your Choice**: O-R-D
   - **Distribution**: 16 drivers chose O-R-D, and 2 chose O-L-D.
   - **Cost Calculation for O-R-D**: \(210 + 10 \times 16 = 370\)
   - **Endowment**: 400, leading to a payoff of \(400 - 370 = 30\)
   - **Regret**: 130, indicating that choosing O-L-D would have cost significantly less.

2. **Analysis**:
   - A majority of drivers again opted for O-R-D, creating a high congestion cost.
   - Only 2 drivers took O-L-D, making the cost for that route \(10 \times 2 + 210 = 230\).
   - The pattern displays repeated high regret when choosing O-R-D, pointing towards higher travel costs.

3. **Strategic Adjustment**:
   - It's apparent that many drivers are consistently choosing O-R-D, but they also perceive high costs associated with it.
   - Expectation theory suggests players may be slow to change paths due to collective movement but given repeated regret, a shift toward O-L-D is logical for reducing costs.
   - Switching back to O-L-D may offer lower congestion if the majority continues on O-R-D.

4. **Decision for this Round**:
   - Choose route **O-L-D**, aiming to capitalize on potential lower traffic and therefore lower costs if competitors continue to primarily select O-R-D.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
  Your Regret: 110


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the results and observations from the past rounds, let's evaluate the situation and make an informed decision:

1. **Review of Previous Round**:
   - **Your Choice**: O-L-D
   - **Distribution**: 15 drivers chose O-L-D, and 3 chose O-R-D.
   - **Cost Calculation for O-L-D**: \(10 \times 15 + 210 = 360\)
   - **Endowment**: 400, leading to a payoff of \(400 - 360 = 40\)
   - **Regret**: 110, indicating that choosing O-R-D would have resulted in lower costs.

2. **Analysis**:
   - The majority continues to stick with O-L-D, contributing to high congestion costs.
   - The cost on O-R-D with just 3 drivers was \(210 + 10 \times 3 = 240\).
   - A high regret indicates less congestion on O-R-D, implying it was the more cost-effective route.

3. **Strategic Adjustment**:
   - There's a consistent pattern of players concentrating on one route, leading to congestion.
   - A switch is likely needed as high regret signals the alternative route could yield lower costs.
   - Predict that some players may be slowly shifting to balance out, but high regret may drive more to switch to O-R-D.

4. **Decision for this Round**:
   - Opt for route **O-R-D**, as this appears to be the less chosen path with lower congestion costs. This decision anticipates that enough players will remain on O-L-D, reducing your travel costs on O-R-D.

2. **Analysis**:
   - A majority chose O-R-D, causing higher congestion costs for that route.
   - The cost on O-L-D with just 3 drivers was \(10 \times 3 + 210 = 240\).
   - The regret indicates that O-L-D was the cheaper option in the previous round.

3. **Strategic Adjustment**:
   - Players often react to high costs and regret by reconsidering their choices.
   - Given the trend, it seems likely that more players may attempt to switch to O-L-D from O-R-D to minimize their costs.
   - Predicting the behavior of other players is critical. They may shift more drastically this time, given the consistent pattern of regret.

4. **Decision for this Round**:
   - Choose **O-L-D**, expecting that some players might persist with O-R-D due to uncertainty, keeping O-L-D relatively less congested and more cost-effective.

LLM Output: To make a strategic decision for the current round, let's analyze the information step-by-step:

1. **Reflection on Previous Round**:
   - **Your Choice**: O-R-D
   - **Distribution**: 14 drivers chose O-R-D, and 4 chose O-L-D.
   - **Cost Calculation for O-R-D**: The cost was \(210 + 10 \times 14 = 350\).
   - **Regret**: 90, this indicates choosing O-L-D would have been less costly.

2. **Cost Insights**:
   - The choice of O-R-D by a large group (14 drivers) resulted in high congestion costs.
   - With only 4 drivers on O-L-D, the cost for that route was \(10 \times 4 + 210 = 250\).
   - The regret suggests that O-L-D would have provided a significantly better outcome in terms of payoff.

3. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Anticipating behavior: Players generally react to high regret by adjusting their route choice in the next round.
   - Predicting that some players will move from O-R-D to O-L-D due to the current regret values.
   - Trying to leverage the potential under-utilization on O-L-D for lower congestion costs.

4. **Decision Strategy**:
   - Given the trends and the previous cost dynamics, moving to O-L-D seems rational to minimize cost, as others might stick to or switch from O-R-D based on regret analysis.
   - Aim to anticipate the majority’s move and choose the route they are less likely to pick.

5. **Final Decision**:
   - Choose **O-L-D**, to capitalize on potentially lower congestion and cost.

   - The cost for drivers on O-R-D was lower at \(210 + 10 \times 6 = 270\).
   - A regret of 50 suggests that shifting to O-R-D could reduce costs.

3. **Behavioral Expectations**:
   - Drivers are likely to react to this regret by adjusting their route decisions to lower costs.
   - Anticipate some players may switch from O-L-D to O-R-D seeking less congestion and better cost efficiency.

4. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - The goal is to anticipate the path that will have fewer drivers, hence lower costs.
   - Use the pattern of switching and adaptation from previous rounds to guide expectations.

5. **Decision for This Round**:
   - Opt for **O-R-D**, because the regret from previous outcomes suggests it might attract less traffic this round, potentially minimizing congestion and costs.

System Message: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```

```


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To decide which route to choose for this round, we need to evaluate each option based on cost calculations, potential driver distribution, and anticipated congestion:

1. **Understanding Route Costs**:
   - **Route O-L-D**: Cost is \(10X + 210\). 
   - **Route O-L-R-D**: Cost is \(10X + 10Y\) (Note that traveling L-R involves no additional cost).
   - **Route O-R-D**: Cost is \(210 + 10Y\).

2. **Decision Factors**:
   - **Segment O-L**: The cost depends on the total number of drivers choosing routes O-L-D or O-L-R-D at Node L.
   - **Segment R-D**: The cost depends on the total number of drivers choosing routes O-L-R-D or O-R-D at Node R.
   - Attempts to predict how drivers might distribute themselves among the routes based on minimizing their potential costs and past behavior if known.

3. **Thought Process**:
   - Choosing **O-L-D**: Faces congestion on both O-L and L-D segments, resulting in potentially high total costs if many choose these initially.
   - Choosing **O-L-R-D**: Utilizes Segment L-R at no additional cost, depending on congestion along both critical segment points (O-L and R-D).
   - Choosing **O-R-D**: Incurred cost of fixed 210 for O-R, adjusted by potential congestion on segment R-D; optimal if fewer drivers choose routes involving R-D but carries congestion risk.

4. **Strategic Anticipation**:
   - Players who experienced high costs previously on routes like O-L-D or O-R-D might shift towards using O-L-R-D to attempt cost optimization.
   - If congestion is anticipated heavily on O-L or R-D, choosing the alternative path through O-L-R-D might be advantageous as it can balance both ends without heavy congestion impacts.
   
5. **Strategic Decision**:
   - Take advantage of the L-R path’s zero cost — choose **O-L-R-D** to potentially balance out drivers across both segment entry points (O-L and R-D), provided both don’t get overly congested simultaneously.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 2, 'O-L-R-D': 16}
  Your Regret: 0


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the results of the previous round, let's analyze and strategize for the current round:

1. **Previous Round Summary**:
   - **Your Choice**: O-L-R-D
   - **Distribution**: 2 drivers on O-R-D, 16 on O-L-R-D.
   - **Regret**: 0, indicating that your choice was optimal and did not result in any regret.

2. **Cost Analysis for O-L-R-D**:
   - **Segment O-L**: \(10 \times 16 = 160\).
   - **Segment L-R**: 0 cost.
   - **Segment R-D**: \(10 \times 18 = 180\) (All 16 from O-L-R-D and 2 from O-R-D).
   - Total cost for O-L-R-D: 160 + 180 = 340.
   
3. **Understanding the Dynamics**:
   - Few drivers chose O-R-D, potentially keeping costs lower on that segment.
   - The heavy choice on O-L-R-D seems to have balanced overall path costs since regret is zero; many found this path optimal in terms of cost.

4. **Predictive Analysis**:
   - Other players are likely to continue using O-L-R-D, perceiving it as cost-effective, leading to potential congestion.
   - Opportunistically using O-R-D could reduce personal cost if the trend leaves it underused again.

5. **Strategy for this Round**:
   - **O-L-D** has been neglected; it may present smaller costs particularly since O-L-R-D is heavily in use, although congestion risks remain.
   - **O-R-D** has been underutilized. If driver flow remains low, this might be the least costly given the fewer participants.
   
6. **Decision**:

LLM Output: Based on the previous round’s outcomes, let’s thoroughly analyze and determine the best route for the current round:

1. **Previous Round Summary**:
   - **Your Choice**: O-R-D
   - **Distribution**: 3 on O-L-D, 10 on O-R-D, 5 on O-L-R-D.
   - **Regret**: 120, indicating significant cost inefficiencies and suggesting other routes were better choices.

2. **Cost Analysis**:
   - **O-L-D**: Cost was likely low due to only 3 drivers choosing this, minimizing congestion on O-L.
   - **O-R-D**: High congestion with 10 drivers resulted in high costs on the R-D segment.
   - **O-L-R-D**: Moderate use, but could have balanced costs due to L-R having no additional cost impact.

3. **Understanding Regret**:
   - Given your regret of 120, the path you chose (O-R-D) was significantly more expensive than at least one alternative.
   - Optimal solutions could involve choosing routes that had less usage or better balance segment costs, likely O-L-D or O-L-R-D.

4. **Behavioral Considerations**:
   - Players experiencing high costs and regret may shift routes this round.
   - O-L-D being underchosen signals a potential opening for a less congested route and lower cost turnaround.

5. **Strategic Decision**:
   - **O-L-D** currently looks attractive due to minimal last-round use, suggesting potential for low congestion and cost savings.
   - **O-L-R-D** remains a balanced option, though concentrated use could pose concerns if many switch from O-R-D.

6. **Decision Making**:
   - Opt for **O-L-D** to take advantage of low previous usage, anticipating it will offer reduced congestion costs if people adjust away from higher racked options (O-R-D).

   - **Distribution**: 10 drivers on O-L-R-D, and 8 on O-L-D.
   - **Regret**: 100, which indicates that another route was significantly more cost-effective.

2. **Cost Analysis**:
   - **O-L-D** involved congestion with 8 drivers on both segments O-L and L-D.
   - **O-L-R-D**: With 10 drivers on it, the costs were also elevated, but it had a trade-off with the zero-cost segment L-R.
   - **O-R-D** was completely unchosen, suggesting minimal cost had it been chosen.

3. **Understanding Regret**:
   - A regret of 100 implies that O-R-D, which had zero drivers, was likely very cost-efficient and represents a missed opportunity.

4. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Anticipate some players may switch away from O-L-D and O-L-R-D due to high regret.
   - O-R-D, being completely neglected, appears as a potential low-cost choice if others remain focused on the L-based routes.

5. **Strategic Decision**:
   - **O-R-D**: With no players previously, it’s likely to be less congested and thus cheaper.
   - **O-L-R-D** still could be balanced but depends on congestion reduction from O-L points.
