System Message: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make an informed decision about which route to select, let's break down the costs associated with each route and consider the potential payoff for each option:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost Function: 10 * X + 210
     - X is the number of participants choosing this route.
   - The cost depends on how many participants choose this route.
   - If many drivers choose this route, the cost increases due to the term 10 * X.

2. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost Function: 210 + 10 * Y
     - Y is the number of participants choosing this route.
   - The cost similarly depends on the number of participants choosing it.
   - If fewer drivers choose this route, the cost will be lower.

**Strategy:**
- Ideally, you want to choose the route that fewer participants are expected to take, as the cost function in both routes increases with the number of users due to the delta influenced parts of the cost function (10 * X for 'O-L-D' and 10 * Y for 'O-R-D').
- Since both routes start and end their cost functions with a base of 210, the distinguishing variable is the first term (10 * X or 10 * Y).

**Risk Assessment:**
- Choosing a route that you predict will be less popular can result in minimal costs.
- However, predicting human behavior can be challenging, as other participants might similarly try to optimize their path based on the previous rounds' trends.

Given no past data from previous rounds or understanding of opponents' behavior:
- It's reasonable to choose a route randomly or switch tactics in future rounds based on observed outcomes and trends.

**Initial Decision:**
- Without any past behavior to analyze, I'll choose 'O-R-D' for the first round, considering that if it's less popular, my cost could be as low as its fixed component (210).

  "route": "O-R-D"

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 4, 'O-R-D': 14}
  Your Regret: 90


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's analyze the information from the previous round to make a more informed decision for the next round:

1. **Previous Round Recap:**
   - Your Choice: O-R-D
   - Route Choice Distribution: 
     - O-L-D: 4 drivers
     - O-R-D: 14 drivers
   - Your Regret: 90

2. **Understanding Regret:**
   - Regret is calculated based on the opportunity cost of not choosing the optimal route in retrospect.
   - The cost for O-R-D was: 210 (fixed) + 10 * 14 = 350
   - The cost for O-L-D was: 10 * 4 + 210 = 250

3. **Implication:**
   - The previous round had significantly fewer drivers on O-L-D, leading to a lower cost compared to O-R-D.
   - The regret of 90 suggests that the cost could have been reduced by choosing O-L-D instead, which was more optimal given fewer drivers.

4. **Strategy for Current Round:**
   - Given the observed behavior, more drivers chose O-R-D, making it a costlier route due to the congestion.
   - It may be reasonable to switch to O-L-D this round, anticipating that the number of drivers on O-R-D was high and might remain high if others stick to their previous choice.

5. **Decision:**
   - Given the prior outcome and assuming similar behavior in other participants, choose route O-L-D as it had fewer participants leading to a lower cost.

```json
{
  "route": "O-L-D"
}
```

Human: You are agent 5.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 18}
  Your Regret: 170


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's examine the outcomes of the previous round to determine a strategy for the current round:

1. **Previous Round Recap:**
   - Your Choice: O-L-D
   - Route Choice Distribution: 
     - O-L-D: 18 drivers
     - O-R-D: 0 drivers
   - Your Regret: 170

2. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - The cost for O-L-D was: 10 * 18 + 210 = 390
   - The cost for O-R-D would have been: 210 + 10 * 0 = 210
   - Everyone chose O-L-D, leading to significant congestion, which significantly increased the cost on that route compared to the idle O-R-D.

3. **Implications of Regret:**
   - A regret of 170 indicates a substantial opportunity cost because the alternative route, O-R-D, had the potential for a far lower cost.
   - This suggests an overreaction from participants switching to O-L-D after the previous results.

4. **Strategy Moving Forward:**
   - The high regret shows a clear incentive for participants to switch to the O-R-D route this round, which had no participants in the previous round and hence, a very low cost.
   - Given the tendency for the group to switch en masse, there's a risk of similar behavior where everyone might switch to O-R-D, leading to congestion there.

5. **Decision:**
   - Predicting mass switching, and given there are no costs reported yet on O-R-D in the next rounds, it is statistically optimal to switch to O-R-D given that it was empty in the last round.

```json
{
  "route": "O-R-D"

```

Human: You are agent 5.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 18}
  Your Regret: 170


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's analyze the outcome from the previous round and make a decision for the current round:

1. **Previous Round Recap:**
   - Your Choice: O-R-D
   - Route Choice Distribution: 
     - O-R-D: 18 drivers
     - O-L-D: 0 drivers
   - Your Regret: 170

2. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - The cost for O-R-D was: 210 + 10 * 18 = 390
   - The cost for O-L-D would have been: 10 * 0 + 210 = 210
   - This round had all participants choosing O-R-D, leading to maximum congestion and costs, while O-L-D remained unused.

3. **Implications of Regret:**
   - A regret of 170 indicates a major opportunity cost by not selecting the completely unused route O-L-D, which was significantly cheaper.
   - This suggests a cycle where participants are reacting strongly to past outcomes.

4. **Strategy for Moving Forward:**
   - Trends show that participants collectively switch routes based on regrets leading to oscillations between fully congested routes.
   - Predicting behaviors, it is likely many will switch back to O-L-D given the high regret associated with O-R-D.

5. **Decision:**
   - Given the high likelihood that participants will react similarly and choose O-L-D in the next round, it would be strategic to select O-L-D. Historically lower costs in observed patterns imply a likely congestion transfer, making it wise to move against the previous round's trend.

```

Human: You are agent 5.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 18}
  Your Regret: 170


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the situation where we've observed oscillating behavior between rounds, let's analyze the strategy from previous outcomes:

1. **Previous Round Recap:**
   - Your Choice: O-L-D
   - Route Choice Distribution: 
     - O-L-D: 18 drivers
     - O-R-D: 0 drivers
   - Your Regret: 170

2. **Understanding the Situation:**
   - The cost for O-L-D was: 10 * 18 + 210 = 390
   - The cost for O-R-D would have been: 210 + 10 * 0 = 210
   - As all participants chose O-L-D, it led to high congestion, making it costly, while O-R-D was left unused and thus cheaper.

3. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - Participants are reacting to high cost and regret by switching en masse to the other route.
   - This behavior results in alternation of congestion from one route to the other.

4. **Strategy Moving Forward:**
   - Anticipating that others will again switch to the less congested, and thus currently cheaper, route O-R-D due to previous high regret from O-L-D.
   - Based on observed behavior so far, choosing the opposite of the previously overcrowded route is a likely strategic decision.

5. **Decision:**
   - Opt for the route O-R-D, as it's expected that participants will switch from the overcrowded O-L-D to O-R-D to optimize their costs based on prior regrets.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 17, 'O-L-D': 1}
  Your Regret: 150


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's analyze the current game situation to make a well-informed decision:

1. **Previous Round Recap:**
   - Your Choice: O-R-D
   - Route Choice Distribution:
     - O-R-D: 17 drivers
     - O-L-D: 1 driver
   - Your Regret: 150

2. **Cost Analysis:**
   - The cost for O-R-D was: 210 + 10 * 17 = 380
   - The cost for O-L-D was: 10 * 1 + 210 = 220

3. **Understanding Regret:**
   - The regret indicates that significant savings could have been made by choosing O-L-D, which had a far lower number of drivers, leading to a substantially lower cost.

4. **Pattern and Behavior Insight:**
   - Many participants seem to have moved to O-R-D, expecting lower congestion, but only one driver chose O-L-D, significantly lowering the congestion-based cost for that route.

5. **Strategy for this Round:**
   - Given the past outcome, a number of participants may now consider switching to O-L-D, having realized its lower costs from the previous round.
   - However, due to potential overreaction, those who are more risk-averse may stick with their previous choice (O-R-D), fearing that everyone will switch.

6. **Decision:**
   - Opt for O-L-D this time, given the trend of high regret associated with congested routes and the chance that more drivers will again try to optimize by distributing themselves more evenly this round.

  Your Regret: 110


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let’s carefully analyze the data to strategize for the next round:

1. **Previous Round Recap:**
   - Your Choice: O-L-D
   - Route Choice Distribution:
     - O-L-D: 15 drivers
     - O-R-D: 3 drivers
   - Your Regret: 110

2. **Cost Analysis:**
   - The cost for O-L-D was: 10 * 15 + 210 = 360
   - The cost for O-R-D was: 210 + 10 * 3 = 240

3. **Understanding Regret:**
   - The regret of 110 indicates that it would have been considerably cheaper to choose O-R-D, as it was significantly less congested with only 3 drivers.

4. **Strategic Behavior and Trends:**
   - A large portion of the group picked O-L-D, likely carrying over from the previous observation that many participants were on O-R-D.
   - With the discrepancy in numbers, many may now look to switch routes to minimize their costs and regret.

5. **Strategize for Current Round:**
   - Observing these dynamics, participants may shift yet again towards O-R-D, seeing it was less congested last round.
   - It often happens that people react strongly to regret, trying to optimize their choices by switching to the previously less congested route.

6. **Decision:**
   - Opt for O-R-D, foreseeing that many will move to it from O-L-D due to the disparity in congestion costs and past regrets.

   - Route Choice Distribution:
     - O-R-D: 16 drivers
     - O-L-D: 2 drivers
   - Your Regret: 130

2. **Cost Analysis:**
   - The cost for O-R-D was: 210 + 10 * 16 = 370
   - The cost for O-L-D was: 10 * 2 + 210 = 230

3. **Understanding Regret:**
   - The regret of 130 indicates that significantly less congestion was present on O-L-D, leading to a much cheaper travel cost.

4. **Strategic Behavior and Trends:**
   - There was a strong shift towards O-R-D, likely due to the majority switching from higher congestion on O-L-D in the previous round.
   - The pattern shows participants tend to reactively switch based on previous regrets, moving en masse to the route previously selected by fewer drivers.

5. **Strategize for Current Round:**
   - Considering the patterns, many participants will likely react to their regret and switch to O-L-D, perceiving it as the less costly route given lower congestion in the previous round.
   - The continued oscillation between routes due to past regrets suggests that predicting the switch and selecting the less congested one could minimize costs.

6. **Decision:**
   - Choose the route O-L-D, anticipating that other participants might now shift their choice from O-R-D, following the trend of prior regrets and distributions.

2. **Cost Analysis:**
   - The cost for O-L-D was: 10 * 17 + 210 = 380
   - The cost for O-R-D was: 210 + 10 * 1 = 220

3. **Understanding Regret:**
   - The regret of 150 suggests that choosing O-R-D would have been much cheaper due to significantly less congestion.
   - With only 1 driver on O-R-D, it was the optimal choice last round due to minimal congestion.

4. **Strategic Behavior Insights:**
   - Despite a predictable pattern of oscillation, many participants chose O-L-D, leading to high congestion and costs.
   - Participants typically switch routes based on regret to optimize costs, meaning they are likely to switch again towards the less populated route.

5. **Expected Behavior for This Round:**
   - Given the high cost and regret from the previous round's choice of O-L-D, it's reasonable to expect many participants to shift to O-R-D this round in search of lower costs.

6. **Decision:**
   - Choose the route O-R-D, anticipating that participants will switch from the previously congested O-L-D based on their observed regret.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To decide on the optimal route for the next round, let's consider the pattern of choices and assess the likely behavior of other participants:

1. **Previous Round Recap:**
   - Your Choice: O-R-D
   - Route Choice Distribution:
     - O-R-D: 17 drivers
     - O-L-D: 1 driver
   - Your Regret: 150

2. **Cost Analysis:**
   - The cost for O-R-D was: 210 + 10 * 17 = 380
   - The cost for O-L-D was: 10 * 1 + 210 = 220

3. **Understanding Regret:**
   - The regret of 150 suggests that the decision to choose O-R-D was suboptimal due to high congestion, while O-L-D offered a much lower travel cost with minimal congestion.

4. **Pattern Recognition and Strategic Insights:**
   - There's a clear oscillation in route choice based on regret – participants tend to switch en masse to the previously less congested route.
   - Many drivers appear to follow the same reactive pattern, switching to the route that demonstrated lesser last round congestion. 

5. **Expected Moves for this Round:**
   - Given the pattern, it’s likely that many participants will now switch to O-L-D, as the regret from last round was high and O-L-D was significantly less congested.
   - This expectation arises from participants trying to optimize costs by anticipating the shifts in crowd distribution.

6. **Decision:**
   - Opt for O-L-D, with the anticipation that participants will switch from the previously congested O-R-D, seeking lower costs based on observed regrets.

   - Route Choice Distribution:
     - O-L-D: 16 drivers
     - O-R-D: 2 drivers
   - Your Regret: 130

2. **Cost Analysis:**
   - The cost for O-L-D was: 10 * 16 + 210 = 370
   - The cost for O-R-D was: 210 + 10 * 2 = 230

3. **Understanding Regret:**
   - The regret of 130 suggests a significant difference in cost, with O-R-D being much cheaper due to far lower congestion.
   - It highlights that choosing O-R-D would have minimized cost effectively in the last round.

4. **Pattern Recognition and Behavioral Insights:**
   - Participants have been cycling based on regret feedback, leading to oscillations.
   - A considerable number of drivers chose O-L-D, leading to higher congestion there and yielding significantly higher regrets for those drivers.

5. **Expected Participant Behavior:**
   - After observing high regret once again from choosing O-L-D last round, it is likely that many will switch to O-R-D in the current round aiming for a cost reduction.
   - Given this switch, the best current strategical move would focus on exploiting any expected overflow due to anticipated mass shifts.

6. **Decision:**
   - Select route O-R-D, expecting a shift towards this route from many participants who will likely respond to last round's high regret associated with O-L-D. This should provide a lower cost option if not overly congested.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make a strategic decision for this round, let’s analyze the insights and data from the previous round:

1. **Previous Round Recap:**
   - Your Choice: O-R-D
   - Route Choice Distribution:
     - O-R-D: 15 drivers
     - O-L-D: 3 drivers
   - Your Regret: 110

2. **Cost Analysis:**
   - The cost for O-R-D was: 210 + 10 * 15 = 360
   - The cost for O-L-D was: 10 * 3 + 210 = 240

3. **Understanding Regret:**
   - The regret of 110 indicates a notable missed opportunity for lower costs by choosing O-L-D, which had substantially lower congestion.
   - Costs were significantly less on O-L-D, resulting in less regret for those drivers.

4. **Patterns and Behavioral Dynamics:**
   - Participants tend to switch based on regret, seeking to optimize their costs by moving to the route with historically lower congestion.
   - High congestion on O-R-D suggests many participants might reassess their decision based on experienced regret from the last round, especially those who were part of the 15 on O-R-D.

5. **Predicted Behavior for This Round:**
   - Given the regret, we can anticipate a shift from O-R-D to O-L-D as participants seek lower costs.
   - Previous patterns show oscillating routes based on where regret was higher, implying changes to less congested routes for cost minimization.

6. **Decision:**
   - Opt for the route O-L-D, predicting that participants will shift from the more congested O-R-D as observed last round to minimize their costs.

LLM Output: Let's use the data from the previous rounds to make an informed decision this time:

1. **Previous Round Recap:**
   - Your Choice: O-L-D
   - Route Choice Distribution:
     - O-L-D: 16 drivers
     - O-R-D: 2 drivers
   - Your Regret: 130

2. **Cost Analysis:**
   - The cost for O-L-D was: 10 * 16 + 210 = 370
   - The cost for O-R-D was: 210 + 10 * 2 = 230

3. **Understanding the Regret:**
   - A regret of 130 suggests a substantial difference in costs between the routes, with O-R-D being much cheaper.
   - The fewer drivers on O-R-D resulted in a lower cost, clearly indicating it was a more optimal choice at that time.

4. **Pattern Recognition and Behavior Analysis:**
   - Participants tend to adjust based on regret, oscillating between routes to find the one with lower costs.
   - Given the high congestion on O-L-D last round, a shift to O-R-D is likely as participants switch to reduce their travel costs and minimize regret.

5. **Expected Behavior in the Current Round:**
   - It's reasonable to anticipate many drivers will move to O-R-D this round after experiencing higher costs on O-L-D.
   - Given past oscillation patterns, drivers react strongly to the cost differences and shift to the route previously underutilized.

6. **Decision:**
   - Choose O-R-D, predicting that many participants will transfer from O-L-D due to higher costs encountered in the last round.

Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make an informed decision, let's analyze each available route based on potential costs and consider the likely decision of other participants:

1. **Route Analysis:**

   - **Route O-L-D:**
     - Cost: \(10X + 210\)
     - X represents the number of participants choosing segment O-L.
     - This route charges both variable congestion costs for O-L and a fixed cost for L-D.

   - **Route O-L-R-D:**
     - Cost: \(10X + 0 + 10Y\)
     - X represents participants on O-L, Y represents participants on R-D.
     - The cost here combines variable costs for two segments: O-L and R-D, but no additional fixed cost at L-R.

   - **Route O-R-D:**
     - Cost: \(210 + 10Y\)
     - Y represents participants on R-D.
     - Offers a fixed cost initially with a congestion cost dependent on the number at R-D.

2. **Considerations:**
   - **Minimizing Costs:**
     - Costs need to be minimized by predicting driver distribution and avoiding heavy congestion on any choice.
   - **Balancing:**
     - Predicting which routes others are inclined to choose based on their prior regrets and likely strategies.
   - **Possible Advantage of O-L-R-D:**
     - Balanced if there’s less congestion, specifically on initial segments, due to avoiding a fixed high L-D cost.

3. **Outcome Prediction:**
   - It’s likely many might choose O-R-D, expecting consistent previous trends in preferences due to fixed initial costs.
   - O-L-D could be avoided due to heavy fixed costs plus congestion potential if many stick to L-D.
   - O-L-R-D might draw fewer initially but depends on O-L being less crowded.

4. **Strategy Approach:**
   - Choose **O-L-R-D** since it likely offers balanced mid-cost variability if congestion is managed at both ends, given that it avoids a fixed charge within L-D.
   - This choice hinges on moderate participation assumptions across nodes O-L and R-D, capitalizing on shared traffic flows to moderate individual cost.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To assess my decision for this round, let's analyze the previous round's outcomes and decide strategically:

1. **Previous Round Summary:**
   - Your Choice: O-L-R-D
   - Route Distribution:
     - O-L-R-D: 17 drivers
     - O-R-D: 1 driver
   - Your Regret: 0

2. **Understanding Regret:**
   - Having 0 regret indicates that O-L-R-D was the optimal choice given the distribution of drivers.
   - Despite high participation, the combined costs were still favorable compared to the lone driver on O-R-D.

3. **Cost Distribution Analysis:**
   - **Route O-L-D:**
     - Potentially high cost as 17 drivers indicate heavy congestion on O-L.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:**
     - Cost structure was advantageous previously but may change with driver shifts.
   - **Route O-R-D:**
     - Despite only 1 driver last time, this presents an unpredictable congestion capacity if everyone decides to switch.

4. **Possible Expectations for This Round:**
   - With a 0 regret outcome, others may stick with O-L-R-D if they also faced minimal regret.
   - Some may shift to O-R-D seeking untapped route with minimal participation.
   - Few drivers may opt for O-L-D, seeking reduced congestion on L-D.

5. **Strategically Managing Risks and Costs:**
   - **Route Consistency:**
     - Staying with O-L-R-D could maintain low-cost structure assuming similar participation trends.
   - **Switching Risk:**
     - Moving to O-R-D presents a gamble; if others switch heavily, it becomes costly due to congestion on R-D.

6. **Final Decision:**
   - Staying with **O-L-R-D** is reasonable if anticipating consistent driver behavior (low shifts).
   - The minimized regret suggests it has been balanced previously; hence maintaining this path might continue to minimize costs.

   - Route Distribution:
     - O-R-D: 12 drivers
     - O-L-D: 2 drivers
     - O-L-R-D: 4 drivers
   - Your Regret: 0

2. **Understanding the Outcome:**
   - A regret of 0 implies that O-L-R-D was optimal for you given the cost incurred relative to other options.
   - The distribution indicates O-R-D was the most popular route, likely increasing congestion costs on R-D.

3. **Cost Structure:**
   - **O-L-D:** With only 2 drivers, it potentially carries much lower congestion-related costs on segment O-L.
   - **O-L-R-D:** With 4 drivers, the distribution here was balanced relative to congestion and cost.
   - **O-R-D:** High congestion with 12 drivers, meaning rising costs on segment R-D, hence possibly not advantageous.

4. **Participant Behavior Insight:**
   - Those on O-R-D with high driver count may seek less congested routes, possibly considering O-L-D or O-L-R-D.
   - The minimal regret outcome suggests stable participation patterns are beneficial.

5. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - **Switch to O-L-D:** Seems potentially low cost due to low congestion (only 2 last round) if you anticipate similar behavior.
   - **Remain on O-L-R-D:** Ensures you capitalize on moderate congestion and zero regret, assuming minor participation fluctuations.
   - **Avoid O-R-D:** High known congestion suggests potential regrets for participants.

6. **Decision Strategy:**

   - Route Distribution:
     - O-L-D: 11 drivers
     - O-L-R-D: 7 drivers
   - Your Regret: 130

2. **Regret and Cost Analysis:**
   - A regret of 130 indicates a significant cost disadvantage for choosing O-L-D, likely due to high congestion on O-L, driving up costs.
   - The O-L-R-D route, with 7 drivers, may have presented lower congestion on R-D, leading to lower travel costs.

3. **Assessing Route Costs:**
   - **O-L-D:** High congestion costs expected on segment O-L with 11 drivers.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Moderate congestion with 7 drivers on O-L, potentially balanced costs on R-D.
   - **O-R-D:** Not used last round, suggesting no congestion cost on R-D, presenting potential for low costs if few switch.

4. **Participant Behavior Insight:**
   - Participants on O-L-D with high regrets will likely look to switch to lessen costs, possibly moving towards O-L-R-D or O-R-D.
   - O-R-D could become appealing if participants anticipate low congestion due to its complete avoidance in the previous round.

5. **Strategic Decision:**
   - **Consider O-L-R-D:** This choice provides a middle-ground if anticipating a more even spread of drivers while managing congestion costs. Additionally, previous results show it can be favorable in terms of balanced participant distribution.
   - **Consider O-R-D:** If anticipating minimal shifts, opting for an underutilized route like O-R-D could reduce costs due to non-existent prior congestion.

   - Route Distribution:
     - O-L-R-D: 9 drivers
     - O-R-D: 9 drivers
   - Your Regret: 0

2. **Understanding the Outcome:**
   - A regret of 0 indicates that the decision to choose O-L-R-D was optimal compared to available alternatives, with costs in balance.
   - An equal split between drivers on O-L-R-D and O-R-D suggests no particular route had a major cost advantage.

3. **Current Cost Analysis:**
   - Since both O-L-R-D and O-R-D had balanced number of drivers, congestion costs are likely similar based on prior distribution.
   - O-L-D was not chosen by many, potentially presenting an opportunity due to absent congestion last round.

4. **Participant Behavior Insight:**
   - With a 0 regret outcome, many drivers may stick to their prior routes, especially when seeing a balanced cost scenario.
   - However, any slight shift or insight inclination by a smaller group could make a difference to perceived and actual congestion.

5. **Strategic Considerations for This Round:**
   - **O-L-R-D or O-R-D:** Staying on either route could maintain balanced congestion. Expect repeated choices from others seeking to maintain equilibrium.
   - **Switch to O-L-D:** If several see the lack of use as a signal for lower cost opportunity, this option could attract drivers wishing to optimize.

6. **Decision Strategy:**
   - Continue with **O-L-R-D**, which has maintained balance and optimal costs in the prior round. 
   - Alternatively, if expecting strategic diversions by others, shifting to O-L-D might capitalize on low initial usage. Nonetheless, O-L-R-D provides predictability with prior conditions.

   - The regret of 110 suggests that either O-R-D was unexpectedly congested, increasing costs, or alternate routes had less congestion effectively reducing costs there.
   - Equal distribution didn’t favor O-R-D as expected, likely due to congestion management or cost distribution differences on shared segments.

3. **Route Cost Dynamics:**
   - **O-L-R-D:** Involves congestion at both O-L and R-D, potentially offering a balanced cost due to fewer regrets.
   - **O-L-D:** Has not been a chosen route recently; fixed cost and congestion on O-L must be contended.
   - **O-R-D:** Balanced costs likely led to evenly split regret; a change in participation could clarify cost differences.

4. **Anticipated Behavioral Adjustments:**
   - With regret over even distribution, participants may reconsider their routes, potentially moving towards the untested O-L-D or rebalancing misuse on O-R-D.
   - Switching to underutilized routes based on previous congestion could lower overall costs.

5. **Strategic Options:**
   - **Try O-L-D:** If anticipating minimal congestion due to shifts, this option mitigates shared segments’ pressures.
   - **Repeat O-L-R-D:** Offers balanced congestion management across O-L and R-D, which maintains cost stability.

6. **Final Decision:**
   - Opt for **O-L-R-D**, considering its previous role in maintaining lower regret across participant distribution; this could combine effective balance and present less cost volatility.

System Message: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To decide intelligently for this round, let's break down the possibilities and potential actions of participants:

1. **Route Options and Cost Analysis:**
   - **O-L-D:** The cost for this route is \(10X + 210\), where \(X\) is the number of drivers using O-L. This route bears a congestion-dependent cost on O-L, plus a fixed cost on L-D.
   - **O-R-D:** The cost is \(210 + 10Y\), where \(Y\) is the number of drivers on R-D. This route includes a fixed cost at O-R, with congestion costs on R-D.

2. **Objective and Strategy:**
   - Aim to minimize your cost by choosing the route with fewer participants, potentially lowering the congestion component of the cost formula.
   - Historical distribution trends and patterns can guide in predicting where others might choose to go.

3. **Participant Behavior Consideration:**
   - If recent rounds indicate a large group taking one route, and encountering high costs, they may shift to the other route.
   - Identifying a balance between both routes can benefit payoff by minimizing congestion influence on costs.

4. **Final Decision Strategy:**
   - Choose the route that currently appears less popular, based on any observed trend data or previous preferences by participants. 
   - No explicit data is provided here, but assuming typical player corrective behavior, consider shifting from a route that perhaps was congested last round if applicable.

5. **Decision:**
   - Without specific data on recent trends, make an educated guess focusing on balancing. Assume O-R-D if unspecified, given its fixed initial component, often attracting more, but plan for cost mitigation.

   - Your Choice: O-R-D
   - Route Distribution:
     - O-L-D: 5 drivers
     - O-R-D: 13 drivers
   - Your Regret: 70

2. **Understanding Regret:**
   - A regret of 70 indicates that choosing O-R-D resulted in a higher cost compared to O-L-D.
   - High participation on O-R-D (13 drivers) led to increased congestion costs on segment R-D.

3. **Route Cost Analysis:**
   - **O-L-D:** With 5 drivers, the cost was \(10 \times 5 + 210 = 260\).
   - **O-R-D:** With 13 drivers, the cost was \(210 + 10 \times 13 = 340\).

4. **Anticipating Participant Shifts:**
   - Given the high regret and congestion on O-R-D, participants may look to switch to O-L-D for cost reduction.
   - Expect some redistribution as participants react and shift to mitigate their previous regrets.

5. **Strategy for This Round:**
   - **Choose O-L-D:** Leverage the potential reduction in participants on O-L-D to minimize congestion costs.
   - The redistribution from O-R-D to O-L-D can balance participant numbers, potentially moderating costs on each segment.

6. **Final Decision:**
   - Opt for **O-L-D**, expecting it will result in lower costs as participants adjust based on past regrets.

     - O-R-D: 1 driver
   - Your Regret: 150

2. **Understanding High Regret:**
   - A regret of 150 indicates significant congestion on O-L-D, causing much higher costs than if O-R-D had been chosen.
   - The lone driver on O-R-D faced minimal congestion costs, leading to much lower travel expenses.

3. **Cost Analysis:**
   - **O-L-D:** The high cost due to \(10 \times 17 + 210 = 380\).
   - **O-R-D:** Minimal congestion cost with 1 driver, cost was \(210 + 10 \times 1 = 220\).

4. **Predicting Participant Behavior:**
   - With substantial regret for drivers on O-L-D, many are likely to switch to O-R-D.
   - This could result in a potential mass shift to O-R-D as participants attempt to avoid the high costs from the previous round.

5. **Decision Strategy:**
   - **Choose O-R-D:** Foresee others moving to this route, capitalizing on reduced costs due to a previously less congested path.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make an effective decision for this round, let's analyze the previous round's results and anticipate participant behavior:

1. **Previous Round Summary:**
   - Your Choice: O-R-D
   - Route Distribution:
     - O-R-D: 17 drivers
     - O-L-D: 1 driver
   - Your Regret: 150

2. **Understanding High Regret:**
   - A regret of 150 indicates substantial congestion on O-R-D, making it an expensive choice compared to O-L-D.
   - With only 1 driver, O-L-D was far less congested and significantly cheaper.

3. **Cost Analysis:**
   - **O-R-D:** Incurred high costs due to heavy congestion, calculated as \(210 + 10 \times 17 = 380\).
   - **O-L-D:** Incurred minimal costs, calculated as \(10 \times 1 + 210 = 220\).

4. **Anticipated Participant Behavior:**
   - Given the high congestion and associated costs on O-R-D, many participants will likely consider switching to O-L-D to minimize travel costs.
   - Participants often react to high congestion costs by selecting less utilized routes to reduce their expenses and regret.

5. **Strategic Decision:**
   - **Switch to O-L-D:** Anticipate a significant participant movement from O-R-D to O-L-D, seeking to avoid congestion and lower their costs.
   - This strategy aligns with expected behavior to rebalance route usage and improve cost efficiency.

6. **Final Decision:**
   - Opt for **O-L-D**, expecting participants to adjust towards this route for more balanced distribution and minimized travel costs based on past high regrets.

System Message: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To decide which route to take this round, let's analyze the characteristics of each available route and anticipate possible participant behaviors:

1. **Route Options and Cost Analysis:**
   - **O-L-D:**
     - Cost: \(10X + 210\)
     - Involves congestion cost on segment O-L and fixed cost on L-D.

   - **O-L-R-D:**
     - Cost: \(10X + 0 + 10Y\)
     - Involves congestion costs on segments O-L and R-D, but avoids the fixed cost at L-D since L-R has no additional charge.

   - **O-R-D:**
     - Cost: \(210 + 10Y\)
     - Includes a fixed cost on O-R and congestion cost on R-D.

2. **Objective and Strategy:**
   - Aim to minimize your costs by choosing the route with fewer participants, thus reducing congestion-based expenses.
   - Understand driver tendencies to adjust choice based on historical congestion and costs.

3. **Participant Behavior Consideration:**
   - If recent rounds result in high costs for a particular route, participants might shift to less congested routes.
   - Balance across routes may occur as drivers try to optimize based on regret from previous choices.

4. **Strategy for This Round:**
   - **Choose O-L-R-D:** If expecting others to shift between O-L-D and O-R-D, this route can leverage lower average congestion across the network, balancing costs over potential underused segments.
   - This route avoids the fixed cost of L-D, providing flexibility in managing congestion.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - Opt for **O-L-R-D**, aiming for minimal congestion impact across more distributed segments and capitalizing on fixed cost avoidance from L-D.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make a strategic decision for this round, let's consider the previous round's results and understand the dynamics that might influence participant choices:

1. **Previous Round Summary:**
   - Your Choice: O-L-R-D
   - Route Distribution:
     - O-L-R-D: 17 drivers
     - O-L-D: 1 driver
   - Your Regret: 0

2. **Understanding Zero Regret:**
   - Zero regret indicates that choosing O-L-R-D was an optimal strategy, balancing costs effectively despite high participation.
   - The fact that the overwhelming majority chose O-L-R-D could mean participants favored the avoidance of the fixed cost at L-D and spread congestion over both O-L and R-D.

3. **Route Analysis:**
   - **O-L-D:** With only 1 driver in the previous round, this route had minimal congestion and was significantly cheaper. However, the fixed cost at L-D remains.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Although heavily utilized, it managed to balance congestion efficiently last round, suggesting effective cost-spreading across O-L and R-D.
   - **O-R-D:** Not chosen in the last round, offering the potential for low congestion costs if others follow the same pattern.

4. **Predicting Driver Behavior:**
   - Participants satisfied with zero regret might stick to O-L-R-D unless they anticipate shifts to O-L-D.
   - Given the massive imbalance, some might explore O-L-D to exploit low congestion, but beware collective moves.

5. **Strategic Decision:**
   - **Consider O-R-D:** Unused last round, presents a potential opportunity if participants overlook it for congestion-free travel.
   - **Stay on O-L-R-D:** If expecting minimal change or double-guessing of O-L-D's attractiveness, this is stable.
   - **Try O-L-D:** Could be highly optimal if expecting balanced participants or exploiting its low previous usage.

6. **Final Decision:**
   - Opt for **O-R-D**, banking on its likely underutilization for potentially low congestion costs and untouched paths since it wasn’t chosen last round.

System Message: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.

     - O-R-D: 9 drivers
   - Your Regret: 110

2. **Analysis of Regret:**
   - A regret of 110 points to significant congestion on both O-L-R-D and O-R-D, resulting in high costs due to equal distribution of drivers.
   - The lack of differentiation in congestion levels between these two routes suggests that an alternative approach is necessary.

3. **Route Dynamics:**
   - **O-L-D:** Remained unused last round, offering the potential for minimized congestion costs if selected strategically.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Managed congestion over two segments, but similar driver numbers led to notable costs.
   - **O-R-D:** Also faced cost issues due to congestion with equal participant numbers, suggesting a need for reduced usage.

4. **Anticipated Driver Adjustments:**
   - With high costs and regret from both congested routes, drivers may see O-L-D as a favorable option given its minimal previous usage and potential for cost savings.
   - Participants often shift toward the least congested path after rounds of high congestion expense.

5. **Strategic Decision:**
   - **Switch to O-L-D:** Take advantage of its lack of recent use to secure cost reductions and avoid congestion.
   - **Consider O-L-R-D cautiously:** Only if expecting stable congestion levels with no other choice value or evident shift.
   - Avoid continuing with O-R-D unless expecting clear participant reduction (evidence not currently in trends).

6. **Final Decision:**
   - Choose **O-L-D**, leveraging the potential for reduced congestion and better cost management as participant preferences adjust.
