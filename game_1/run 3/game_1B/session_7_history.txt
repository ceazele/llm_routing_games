System Message: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make an informed decision, let's analyze each available route using logical reasoning and the provided cost structure:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Total Cost = 10X + 210
   - Here, X is the number of drivers choosing this route or the segment O-L. This cost depends on congestion on segment O-L. As more drivers choose this route, both components of the cost increase. 

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Total Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y
   - In this route, the cost is influenced by segment O-L (shared with route O-L-D) and segment R-D. Y represents the number of other drivers choosing routes involving segment R-D.
   - The cost could be higher if both O-L and R-D become congested.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Total Cost = 210 + 10Y
   - Only segment R-D impacts the cost here, perhaps making it simpler to predict compared to route O-L-D.

Let's consider potential strategic decisions:

- If many participants are expected to choose O-L-D or O-L-R-D, then segment O-L might be quite congested as those two routes share that segment.
- Routes O-L-R-D and O-R-D both rely on R-D, but O-R-D doesn't add the variable cost from O-L.

#### Decision Consideration:
- Route O-R-D has a predictable starting cost due to fewer variables: a fixed cost (210) plus the congestion cost solely from R-D. If segment R-D is less congested than segment O-L, or even similarly congested, it might be the most stable route economically.

Given these considerations, and the fact we aim to minimize costs, Route **O-R-D** seems to present the least uncertain option in terms of cost due to its reliance solely on segment R-D after the fixed initial cost. This route avoids any variable costs from segment O-L. 

Based on the above analysis, I'll choose:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-R-D': 7, 'O-L-D': 4, 'O-R-D': 7}
  Your Payoff: 50


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's analyze the situation based on the given summary of the previous round:

1. **Previous Round Results:**
   - Your Previous Choice: O-R-D
   - Route Choice Distribution:
     - O-L-R-D: 7 drivers
     - O-L-D: 4 drivers
     - O-R-D: 7 drivers (including yourself)
   - Your Payoff: 50, which means your cost was 350 (since 400 - 350 = 50).

2. **Cost Analysis:**
   - For O-R-D: Previous Cost = 210 + (10 * 7) = 210 + 70 = 280, but your actual cost from payoff indicates 350.
   - The error in calculation implies misunderstanding; in fact, the other segment R-D should incur more cost.

3. **Understanding Congestion Effects:**
   - Based on the previous distribution, O-R-D and O-L-R-D are equally congested.
   - This suggests a need to rethink based on both fixed costs and influenced segments.

4. **Evaluating Alternative Routes:**
   - **O-L-D:** 
     - Cost = \(10X + 210\)
     - Last round: (10 * 11) + 210 = 110 + 210 = 320.
     - Fewer routes use O-L segment relatively, might offer slightly less congestion despite higher starting cost with O-L-R-D.
   - **O-L-R-D:**
     - Cost = \(10X + 0 + 10Y\)
     - Last round: consistent with O-R-D congestion for R-D because 7 drivers used R-D component.
  
5. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - The choice for O-L-D is potentially optimal if the 4-route choice doesn’t vary significantly.
   - O-L-D showed lesser congestion than alternatives.

Given these evaluations, adapting a new strategy focused on reducing variable costs by considering lesser congestion routes might improve payoff:

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-R-D': 5, 'O-R-D': 5, 'O-L-D': 8}
  Your Payoff: 60


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's analyze the situation based on the given summary of the previous round:

1. **Previous Round Results:**
   - Your Previous Choice: O-L-D
   - Route Choice Distribution:
     - O-L-R-D: 5 drivers
     - O-R-D: 5 drivers
     - O-L-D: 8 drivers (including yourself)
   - Your Payoff: 60, indicating a cost of 340 (since 400 - 340 = 60).

2. **Cost Calculations:**
   - For O-L-D: Previous Cost = \( (10 \times 8) + 210 = 80 + 210 = 290 \)
   - The cost calculation matches the choice distribution and suggests a better context for decisions.

3. **Understanding Congestion Effects:**
   - O-L-D became more congested in the previous round with 8 drivers.
   - Distribution indicates a fairly equal split among the three routes.

4. **Evaluating Alternatives:**
   - **O-R-D:** 
     - Cost = \(210 + (10 \times Y)\)
     - Applied Distribution = 210 + (10 \times 5) = 260
     - Considering less congestion allows a lower cost if trends persist.
   - **O-L-R-D:** 
     - Cost = \( (10 \times X) + 0 + (10 \times Y) \)
     - Applied costs remain variable depending on shared sections.

5. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Reducing costs means targeting routes with reduced variable factors.
   - O-R-D appears most economical given distribution isn't favoring heavy use on segment R-D.

**Decision Recommendation:**
- Choose O-R-D with an anticipated shift from highly used segments to manage costs efficiently.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-R-D': 13, 'O-R-D': 5}
  Your Payoff: 10


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's critically evaluate the scenario based on the summary of the previous round:

1. **Previous Round Results:**
   - Your Previous Choice: O-R-D
   - Route Choice Distribution:
     - O-L-R-D: 13 drivers
     - O-R-D: 5 drivers (including yourself)
   - Your Payoff: 10, indicating a cost of 390 (since 400 - 390 = 10).

2. **Cost Calculations:**
   - For O-R-D: Previous Cost = \(210 + (10 \times 5) = 210 + 50 = 260\)
   - The previously anticipated advantage from less congestion on R-D segment wasn't realized, impacting costs drastically, however reflecting slight miscomputation in assumptions.

3. **Understanding Congestion Effects:**
   - Distribution leaned heavily towards O-L-R-D, influencing high congestion costs overall.
   - O-L-D wasn’t chosen as anticipated, suggesting a shift back might aid cost reduction.

4. **Evaluating Strategic Options:**
   - **O-L-D:** Likely to have lower users and could be less congested moving forward.
   - **O-L-R-D:** High traffic from the previous round, likely continues to have a higher cost.
   - **O-R-D:** Subpar payoff allocation here despite lower choice distribution.

5. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - A shift to O-L-D might reduce congestion influence, assuming unchanged distribution habits.
   - Diversifying from heavily used segments could yield new tactical benefits, and historical reluctance indicates O-L-D might avoid prior costly outcomes.

Given this evaluation, moving to the less congested O-L-D, potentially marginalized now, could offer improved payoff:

  Your Payoff: 100


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's analyze the situation based on the summary of the previous round:

1. **Previous Round Results:**
   - Your Previous Choice: O-L-D
   - Route Choice Distribution:
     - O-L-D: 9 drivers (including yourself)
     - O-R-D: 9 drivers
     - O-L-R-D: 0 drivers
   - Your Payoff: 100, indicating a cost of 300 (since 400 - 300 = 100).

2. **Cost Calculations:**
   - For O-L-D: Previous Cost = \( (10 \times 9) + 210 = 90 + 210 = 300 \)
   - This cost is consistent with the payoff received.

3. **Understanding Congestion Effects:**
   - An equal split between O-L-D and O-R-D implies equilibrium, but no user opted for O-L-R-D, suggesting it's seen as higher risk/cost.
   - Historically O-R-D has seen high variability in congestion based on the earlier results.

4. **Evaluating Strategic Options:**
   - **O-L-D:** Showed a stable, competitive payoff stability in the prior round.
   - **O-R-D:** Similar cost structure but the potential of increased congestion if more users switch.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Potentially avoided by others, but could suddenly become less relevant cost-wise if congestion perceptions change; currently has an immediate drawback from perception.

5. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Retaining O-L-D affords a known variable cost and stable yield, beneficial as adjustments appear gradually.
   - The predictability of O-L-D, with shared costs, grants a competitive edge without sudden congestion spikes.

Based on this analysis, it's advisable to continue with the **O-L-D** route for steadier payoff potential while avoiding drastic shifts in driver behavior.

  Your Payoff: 20


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's analyze the situation based on the summary of the previous round:

1. **Previous Round Results:**
   - Your Previous Choice: O-L-D
   - Route Choice Distribution:
     - O-L-R-D: 15 drivers
     - O-L-D: 2 drivers (including yourself)
     - O-R-D: 1 driver
   - Your Payoff: 20, indicating a cost of 380 (since 400 - 380 = 20).

2. **Cost Calculations:**
   - For O-L-D: Previous Cost = \( (10 \times 2) + 210 = 20 + 210 = 230 \)
   - However, your payoff indicates a different experience; there may be a calculation error or misunderstanding in earlier expectations.

3. **Understanding Congestion Effects:**
   - A sudden shift towards O-L-R-D means it's heavily congested and likely to incur high costs.
   - O-L-D saw very few users, yet the payoff was exceptionally low, suggesting misalignment between expected and actual outcomes.
   - O-R-D being rarely chosen implies an expectation of higher or uncertain cost previously.

4. **Evaluating Strategic Options:**
   - **O-L-D:** Currently very low usage, yet the payoff was not as anticipated.
   - **O-L-R-D:** High congestion but isolating this route might reveal tactical avoidance value.
   - **O-R-D:** Generally lower usage now, potentially underutilized, therefore less congested.

5. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - **O-R-D** appears to be an advantageous choice due to its under-utilization, which might reduce congestion impacts significantly versus historical results.
   - Leveraging less used routes (O-R-D) might yield better economic performance as congestion shifts from the normative path (O-L-R-D).

Based on this analysis, shifting, leveraging misalignment, and selecting **O-R-D** can optimize for minimal congestion and better potential payoffs:

  Your Payoff: 20


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's carefully evaluate the scenario using the summary of the previous round:

1. **Previous Round Results:**
   - Your Previous Choice: O-R-D
   - Route Choice Distribution:
     - O-R-D: 17 drivers (including yourself)
     - O-L-D: 1 driver
     - O-L-R-D: 0 drivers
   - Your Payoff: 20, indicating a cost of 380 (since 400 - 380 = 20).

2. **Cost Calculations:**
   - For O-R-D: Previous Cost = \(210 + (10 \times 17) = 210 + 170 = 380\)
   - This cost is consistent with the payoff received.

3. **Understanding Congestion Effects:**
   - O-R-D became highly congested with almost all participants choosing it, which drastically increased the cost.
   - O-L-D was chosen by only 1 driver, meaning its segments likely have very low or zero congestion.
   - O-L-R-D went unchosen, suggesting participants perceive it as unfavorable potentially due to past experiences or misperceptions.

4. **Evaluating Strategic Options:**
   - **O-L-D:** Extremely low user count, suggesting minimal congestion and potentially lower costs now.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Zero use recently, it could be beneficial if congestion shifts away.
   - **O-R-D:** Overcrowded currently, objectively less favorable due to increased cost from congestion.

5. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Switching to **O-L-D** potentially offers the lowest cost due to the minimal usage in the previous round, allowing for reduced congestion factors and a better payoff.
   - Observing the behavior shift towards one route historically, a major adjustment might flank costs significantly.

Given the analysis, selecting **O-L-D** for its presently underutilized path and potential cost benefits is a strategic choice:

   - Your Previous Choice: O-L-D
   - Route Choice Distribution:
     - O-L-D: 18 drivers (including yourself)
     - O-L-R-D: 0 drivers
     - O-R-D: 0 drivers
   - Your Payoff: 10, indicating a cost of 390 (since 400 - 390 = 10).

2. **Cost Calculations:**
   - For O-L-D: Previous Cost Calculation = \( (10 \times 18) + 210 = 180 + 210 = 390\)
   - This cost exactly matches the payoff received, illustrating high congestion.

3. **Understanding Congestion Effects:**
   - Every participant chose O-L-D, leading to maximum congestion on segments O-L and subsequent L-D.
   - No interest in either O-L-R-D or O-R-D last round, leaving their potential congestion costs unexplored.

4. **Evaluating Strategic Options:**
   - **O-L-D:** Overutilized at this point, thus expensive due to high collective participation.
   - **O-L-R-D:** No usage and thus offers an open opportunity for a potentially less costly route.
   - **O-R-D:** Also not chosen recently, likely minimal congestion, which makes it promising.

5. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Shifting to either **O-L-R-D** or **O-R-D** that were not utilized previously, giving potential for significantly reduced costs.
   - The switching strategy for unexplored routes likely minimizes costs further as they were entirely avoided, detailed reasons such as habit diffusion shifting might catalyze others too.

Given the analysis, pursuing **O-R-D** due to its past unutilized status and uncaptured potential relief from congestion is advisable:

2. **Cost Calculations:**
   - For O-R-D: Previous Cost = \(210 + (10 \times 12) = 210 + 120 = 330\)
   - Given total choices at O-R-D, the calculated cost does not typically equate to the payoff; reconsider experience indicates heavy traffic resulted.

3. **Understanding Congestion Effects:**
   - O-R-D has seen heavy usage contributing to high costs due to driver congregation.
   - O-L-R-D also bears congestion, but less so than O-R-D.
   - O-L-D went unused, suggesting minimal congestion and a chance for a better payoff opportunity now.

4. **Evaluating Strategic Options:**
   - **O-L-D** presents a fresh, consistently untraveled route with limited present congestion. Consider targeting underused routes to mitigate cost.
   - **O-L-R-D** offers alternatives but has shared impacts with O-R-D on R-D segment, retaining relational congestion elements.
   - **O-R-D** proved congested with penalizing costs.

5. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Transitioning to **O-L-D** could mitigate costs with fewer associated congestion penalties given its unused status last round.
   - Here, O-L-D avails an under-explored segment area free from prior interference, distinctly optimized for minimal cost trajectory.

Given these analyses, opting for **O-L-D** aligns with disruption mitigation, aiming to allocate more favorable payoff in contrast to saturated choices:

3. **Understanding Congestion Effects:**
   - O-L-D has been heavily used, encountering the highest congestion and resultant costs.
   - Lesser use of O-L-R-D indicates moderate congestion but still impactful due to shared segments.
   - O-R-D remains completely unused, representing potential for minimal congestion and lower costs.

4. **Evaluating Strategic Options:**
   - **O-L-D:** Currently overutilized, risks high congestion costs if chosen again.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Moderate use, but similar congestion outcomes due to shared routes.
   - **O-R-D:** Unused, offering an opportunity for a potentially cost-effective travel choice with no current congestion.

5. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Shift consideration towards **O-R-D**, leveraging its underutilized status for reduced costs due to potential minimal segment occupancy.
   - Transitioning routes allows focusing on uncongested pathways, recalibrating cost balance due to non-interference history.

   - Significant congestion on the O-R-D route led to high costs, with full participation from many drivers adversely affecting the payoff.

3. **Understanding Congestion Effects:**
   - O-R-D was utilized by many, leading to escalated congestion and costs.
   - O-L-R-D has fewer users, suggesting ongoing shared congestion though less than the chosen route.
   - O-L-D remains untouched in recent rounds and may present a less congested and more cost-effective option now.

4. **Evaluating Strategic Options:**
   - **O-R-D:** Overcrowded, evidenced by low payoff due to high congestion.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Moderate congestion shared with O-R-D, affecting rotational payoff.
   - **O-L-D:** Completely unchosen recently, suggesting low congestion and the likelihood of lower costs.

5. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Switching to **O-L-D** is advisable considering no recent use, which indicates minimal congestion and a chance for optimal cost management.
   - Leveraging an underutilized route often results in improved efficiency by mitigating past congestion challenges.

   - Selecting **O-L-D** could be advantageous given its lack of usage indicates minimal congestion, and thus likely provides the opportunity for reduced costs.
   - Prioritizing the path with minimal congestion is key to minimizing expenses and achieving better payoffs.

Based on this careful consideration, opting for **O-L-D** should help manage congestion-related expenses and improve potential payoffs:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 7.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 14, 'O-L-R-D': 4}
  Your Payoff: 10


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To decide strategically for the next round, let's carefully analyze the pattern from previous rounds and adapt a strategy based on congestion and distribution:

1. **Previous Round Results:**
   - Your Previous Choice: O-L-D
   - Route Choice Distribution:
     - O-L-D: 14 drivers (including yourself)
     - O-L-R-D: 4 drivers
     - O-R-D: 0 drivers
   - Your Payoff: 10, indicating a cost of 390 (since 400 - 390 = 10).

2. **Cost Analysis:**
   - For O-L-D: Previous Cost = \( (10 \times 14) + 210 = 140 + 210 = 350 \)
   - The high number of drivers has caused substantial congestion on O-L-D, leading to increased costs and reduced payoff.

3. **Understanding Congestion Impacts:**
   - O-L-D is heavily congested due to the large number of drivers, significantly affecting travel costs.
   - O-L-R-D had fewer drivers, leading to moderate congestion, but it still incurs some cost due to its moderate share of the total traffic.
   - O-R-D was not chosen, suggesting it remains free of congestion and presents a lower-cost opportunity.

4. **Evaluating Strategic Options:**
   - **O-L-D:** Continual heavy usage leads to high congestion costs.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Moderately congested, but could be a better choice than O-L-D with less traffic.
   - **O-R-D:** Completely unused, indicating minimal congestion and promising potential for cost efficiency.

5. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Switching to **O-R-D** is appealing due to its previous lack of selection, signaling minimal congestion and potentially the lowest costs.
   - Opt for the path with minimal congestion to better manage expenses and improve payoff potential.

Taking these insights into account, selecting **O-R-D** should help minimize congestion-related costs and enhance payoff potential:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 7.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-R-D': 7, 'O-R-D': 11}
  Your Payoff: 10


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make an informed decision for the next round, let's unpack the previous round's results and thoughtfully choose a strategy:

1. **Previous Round Results:**
   - Your Previous Choice: O-R-D
   - Route Choice Distribution:
     - O-L-R-D: 7 drivers
     - O-R-D: 11 drivers (including yourself)
     - O-L-D: 0 drivers
   - Your Payoff: 10, indicating a cost of 390 (since 400 - 390 = 10).

2. **Cost Analysis:**
   - For O-R-D: The cost structure was \(210 + (10 \times 11) = 210 + 110 = 320\)
   - The choice and distribution led to significant congestion on O-R-D, resulting in high costs and a low payoff.

3. **Understanding Congestion Impacts:**
   - O-R-D faced substantial congestion and associated costs due to high driver usage.
   - O-L-R-D, with fewer drivers, experienced moderate congestion, offering somewhat lower costs.
   - O-L-D was not utilized, suggesting that it may be free of congestion and could enhance cost efficiency.

4. **Evaluating Strategic Options:**
   - **O-R-D:** Continues to incur high costs from congestion due to high usage.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Moderately congested, offering cost moderation but involving shared segments.
   - **O-L-D:** Remained unused, presenting the best opportunity for minimal congestion and reduced costs.

5. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Opting for **O-L-D** is potentially advantageous since it was not chosen and indicates minimized congestion, which could reduce costs significantly.
   - Targeting the least congested route will likely result in lower travel costs and improve potential payoffs.

Based on this analysis, selecting **O-L-D** seems the most promising choice to minimize congestion costs and enhance potential returns:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 7.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-L-R-D': 3}
  Your Payoff: 10

   - Your Previous Choice: O-L-D
   - Route Choice Distribution:
     - O-L-D: 15 drivers (including yourself)
     - O-L-R-D: 3 drivers
     - O-R-D: 0 drivers
   - Your Payoff: 10, indicating a cost of 390 (since 400 - 390 = 10).

2. **Cost Analysis:**
   - For O-L-D: Cost = \( (10 \times 15) + 210 = 150 + 210 = 360 \)
   - O-L-D was highly congested with 15 drivers, leading to increased costs and reduced payoff.

3. **Understanding Congestion Impacts:**
   - O-L-D's congestion resulted in elevated travel expenses due to a high driver count.
   - O-L-R-D, with 3 drivers, faced much lower congestion and potentially lower costs.
   - O-R-D was not selected, suggesting no congestion and offering a favorable opportunity for reduced costs.

4. **Evaluating Strategic Options:**
   - **O-L-D:** Continues to be heavily congested, leading to high costs.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Experienced less congestion and could be a better option than O-L-D.
   - **O-R-D:** Unused, indicating potential for minimal congestion and lower costs.

5. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - Switching to **O-R-D** appears advantageous, as it was not chosen previously. It suggests minimal congestion, thereby potentially reducing costs and improving payoffs.
