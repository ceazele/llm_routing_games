System Message: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make the decision for the route selection, let's analyze each route:

1. **Route O-L-D**:
   - Cost = 10X + 210
   - X is the number of drivers choosing segment O-L.
   - This route involves a variable cost that can increase significantly if many drivers choose it, plus a fixed cost of 210.

2. **Route O-L-R-D**:
   - Cost = 10X + 0 + 10Y 
   - X is the number of drivers choosing segment O-L.
   - Y is the number of drivers choosing segment R-D.
   - This route adds two segments with variable costs. While it doesn't have additional fixed costs, the combined variable costs can be high depending on how many choose these segments.

3. **Route O-R-D**:
   - Cost = 210 + 10Y
   - Y is the number of drivers choosing segment R-D.
   - This route has a fixed cost of 210 plus a variable cost on segment R-D.

**Strategic Evaluation**:
- Route O-L-D has a potentially high cost due to dependency on O-L congestion but offers simplicity in having just one segment with variable cost.
- Route O-L-R-D is problematic because it combines the variability of both O-L and R-D without the benefit of reducing the distance or decreasing the number of segments, leading to potentially high total costs.
- Route O-R-D offers the control of a fixed cost segment with one variable cost segment at R-D. It leverages Route R-D as part of many people traveling directly on O-R, potentially spreading out the cost on R-D and reducing individual cost spikes.

Given that I aim to minimize potential increases from variable costs, and noting the likelihood of other participants opting for straightforward routes, a safe strategy would be to choose Route O-R-D as it controls costs better with fewer variables and less dependency on congestion at O-L.

Thus, the decision is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 3.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-R-D': 7, 'O-L-D': 4, 'O-R-D': 7}
  Your Payoff: 50


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make a decision for the current round, let's analyze what happened in the previous round and what could be done differently to optimize the payoff.

**Previous Round Analysis**:
- You chose Route O-R-D, and your payoff was 50.
- The distribution was: 7 drivers on O-L-R-D, 4 drivers on O-L-D, and 7 drivers (including you) on O-R-D.
- With 7 drivers on O-R-D, the cost would have been: 210 (fixed) + 10Y with Y = 7, leading to a total cost of 280. Subtracting this from the endowment of 400 gives a payoff of 50.

**Analyzing Each Route**:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 210
   - With 4 drivers last round, choosing this route would have resulted in a cost of 250. This would have provided a payoff of 150.
   - The number of drivers was lower here, reducing the variable cost impact.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 10Y
   - X and Y were both 7 last round, leading to a total cost of 280 and thus a payoff of 120.
   - This route involves both variable costs from O-L and R-D. With moderate to high participation, this cost can become quite high.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost = 210 + 10Y
   - Though it had the same participation as O-L-R-D, the payoff was the same due to similar costs but limited to just the R-D segment.

**Considerations**:
- Route O-L-D had only 4 drivers, presenting a lower movement, hence less congestion on O-L, which led to a lower total cost last round. This suggests an opportunity to improve the payoff.
- If Route O-R-D continues to attract many drivers, it could remain costly due to the variable cost on R-D when many choose it too.
- Ideally, I should aim for a balance where the chosen route has fewer participants to minimize variable costs, maximizing the final payoff.

**Strategy Decision**:
- Given the potential payoff on Route O-L-D when fewer people chose it last round, it could be more beneficial in this round if the trend continues.
- Switching to this route might optimize the payoff, given last round's data.

Thus, the decision is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 3.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-R-D': 5, 'O-R-D': 5, 'O-L-D': 8}
  Your Payoff: 60


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make a decision for the current round, let's analyze the outcome of the previous round and evaluate each route option to optimize the payoff.

**Previous Round Analysis**:
- You chose Route O-L-D and received a payoff of 60.
- The distribution was: 5 drivers on O-L-R-D, 5 drivers on O-R-D, and 8 drivers on O-L-D.
- With 8 drivers on O-L-D, the cost would have been 10X + 210, where X = 8, leading to a total cost of 290. Subtracting this from the endowment of 400 results in a payoff of 60.

**Analyzing Each Route**:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 210
   - Last round, this route gathered 8 drivers, which increased the variable cost due to congestion on O-L to 80 (10 * 8).
   - While this route has potential, high participation leads to relatively lower payoff.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 10Y
   - With 5 drivers choosing this route, the variable costs on O-L and R-D made it a viable option in terms of cost. Assuming X = Y = 5, the total cost would be 100.
   - This route can be advantageous with fewer drivers, potentially lowering the overall cost to benefit payoff.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost = 210 + 10Y
   - This route was also chosen by 5 drivers, similar to O-L-R-D, which lowers the cost to a more reasonable level compared to O-L-D.
   - The fixed cost of segment O-R adds predictability, which might work better if O-L is crowded.

**Considerations**:
- Route O-L-D was crowded last round, pushing its cost high. This inefficiency suggests exploring alternatives with potentially less congestion.
- Routes O-L-R-D and O-R-D had equal participation, making them more appealing due to lower congestion impact.
- The game dynamics suggest that seeking a balance with fewer participants is key to minimizing costs.

**Strategy Decision**:
- Switching to a route with fewer drivers could enhance payoff. Last round's trend on Route O-L-D indicates too many drivers, so opting for an alternative could be beneficial.
- Given the balance observed on O-L-R-D and O-R-D, and considering the fixed cost advantage without mutual congestion involvement from two segments on O-R-D, I'll choose Route O-R-D.

Thus, the decision is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 3.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-R-D': 13, 'O-R-D': 5}
  Your Payoff: 10


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To decide on the optimal route for this round, let's dissect the results from the previous round and evaluate each route option to refine the strategy for maximizing payoff.

**Previous Round Analysis**:
- You chose Route O-R-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The route distribution was: 13 drivers on O-L-R-D and 5 drivers on O-R-D.
- With 5 drivers on O-R-D, the cost amounted to 210 + 10Y, where Y = 5, resulting in a total cost of 260. Subtracting from the 400 endowment gives a payoff of 140.
- However, if the reported payoff was lower, there might be another factor or error to consider in redesigning the strategy.

**Analyzing Each Route**:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 210
   - This route was not chosen according to the distributed data from the last round, suggesting no congestion at O-L.
   - With this being potentially less crowded and unused last round, it offers an opportunity for reduced costs if others do not suddenly opt for it.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 10Y
   - This route was heavily crowded with 13 drivers, significantly increasing the variable costs. Hence, choosing this route would lead to high costs due to congestion both on O-L and R-D.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost = 210 + 10Y
   - Last round of 5 drivers continuing along O-R-D suggests moderate participation.
   - The control of costs might trend well with fewer players but can suffer if O-L-R-D's crowd shifts to fill this segment.
  
**Considerations**:
- Route O-L-D was not used last round, suggesting no congestion. This indicates that if the same trend continues, I might capitalize on lower variable costs.
- Avoiding the clearly popular O-L-R-D is favorable to avoid high costs resulting from its popularity last round.
- With O-L-D unoccupied, the potential of finding lower variable cost makes it attractive.

**Strategy Decision**:
- Given the popularity trend on Route O-L-R-D and comparing costs incurred previously, attempting Route O-L-D should optimize the payoff, particularly with no recent traffic data.
- The strategy revolves around leveraging least popular and uncrowded pathways to decrease overall travel costs.

Thus, the decision is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 3.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 9, 'O-R-D': 9}
  Your Payoff: 100


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make a decision for the current round, let's analyze the previous round's outcome and evaluate each route option to maximize the payoff.

**Previous Round Analysis**:
- You chose Route O-L-D and received a payoff of 100.
- The route distribution was: 9 drivers on O-L-D and 9 drivers on O-R-D, with 0 on O-L-R-D.
- With 9 drivers on O-L-D, the cost was 10X + 210, where X = 9, resulting in a total cost of 300. Subtracting this from the 400 endowment gives a payoff of 100.

**Analyzing Each Route**:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 210
   - While this route had moderate participation with 9 drivers last round, leading to a cost of 300, the payoff was decent but not optimal.
   - It was equally shared with O-R-D, indicating that players diverged evenly between the two available direct routes.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 10Y
   - Nobody chose this route last round, suggesting potential for fewer drivers this round if the trend persists, minimizing congestion costs ideally.
   - However, the dual segments with variable costs make it a risky choice if others start considering it due to no traffic last round.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost = 210 + 10Y
   - With 9 drivers, it mirrored Route O-L-D for participation.
   - It means similar levels of congestion and total costs applied here, with the benefit of a fixed central segment.

**Considerations**:
- Both O-L-D and O-R-D were equally occupied, each involving 9 drivers. This suggests re-evaluation as the costs became identical.
- The completely unoccupied O-L-R-D could be leveraged for potential better cost management if other participants ignore this route again.

**Strategy Decision**:
- Given the unoccupied O-L-R-D, there's potential to use this route as others avoid it, potentially reducing both variable costs (X and Y).
- Balancing potential payoff against risk, trying Route O-L-R-D might offer the lowest costs and highest payoff if traffic remains low.
  
Thus, I’ll choose:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 3.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-R-D': 15, 'O-L-D': 2, 'O-R-D': 1}
  Your Payoff: 70


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make a strategic decision for this round, let's assess the previous round's outcomes and analyze each route option to optimize the payoff.

**Previous Round Analysis**:
- You chose Route O-L-R-D and received a payoff of 70.
- The route distribution was: 15 drivers on O-L-R-D, 2 drivers on O-L-D, and 1 driver on O-R-D.
- With 15 drivers on O-L-R-D, the cost was 10X + 10Y, where X = 15 and Y = 15, resulting in a total cost of 300. Subtracting this from the 400 endowment gives the payoff of 100, but it seems the corresponding completed value was lower, indicating another factor or an error.

**Analyzing Each Route**:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 210
   - Last round, only 2 drivers chose this route, minimizing congestion on segment O-L.
   - The sparse participation suggests this route had a comparatively low cost, providing a chance for optimal payoff if traffic remains low.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 10Y
   - Heavily congested with 15 drivers last round, indicating high costs due to high participation across two variable segments.
   - With increased demand, this route's cost spirals, offering a reduced payoff.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost = 210 + 10Y
   - Only 1 driver chose this route, suggesting minimal congestion on segment R-D.
   - The low participation indicates a significantly reduced cost, providing an opportunity for higher payoff with minimal competitors.

**Considerations**:
- Route O-L-R-D was heavily used, signaling an excessive variable cost that significantly affects the payoff negatively.
- Routes O-L-D and O-R-D had little participation, indicating they might be underutilized and potentially more efficient given lower congestion influences.

**Strategy Decision**:
- With little activity on Routes O-L-D and O-R-D, switching to these may result in a lower total cost given minimal congestion.
- Evaluating payoff potential versus risk, choosing Route O-R-D appears advantageous due to its fixed segment and minimal competition on its variable segment.

Thus, the decision is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 3.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 17, 'O-L-D': 1}
  Your Payoff: 20


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To decide on the optimal route for this round, let's carefully analyze the previous round's outcome and reassess each route option to improve the payoff.

**Previous Round Analysis**:
- You chose Route O-R-D and received a payoff of 20.
- The route distribution was: 17 drivers on O-R-D and 1 driver on O-L-D.
- With 17 drivers on O-R-D, the cost was 210 + 10Y, where Y = 17, resulting in a total cost of 380. Subtracting this from the 400 endowment gives a payoff of 20.

**Analyzing Each Route**:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 210
   - Only 1 driver chose this route last round, indicating extremely low congestion on segment O-L.
   - This minimal participation signals potentially lower costs and a higher payoff if the situation remains consistent with little traffic.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 10Y
   - Not chosen last round, hinting at potential opportunity if others continue to ignore this route.
   - Potentially low costs if participation remains minimal, as segments O-L and R-D were majorly unused.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost = 210 + 10Y
   - Extremely high congestion last round, resulting in significantly increased costs, leading to minimal payoff.
   - Participation is high, suggesting high risk unless drastically reducing the crowded variable segment.

**Considerations**:
- Route O-R-D was saturated, leading to undesirable costs.
- Routes O-L-D and O-L-R-D seem underutilized, implying an opportunity for improved cost if traffic remains light.

**Strategy Decision**:
- Given the high cost due to congestion on O-R-D, switching away from this crowded segment is recommended.
- Examining the sparse usage of O-L-D, choosing it offers the most efficient route to potentially minimize costs and maximize payoff if others continue to overlook this path.

Thus, the decision is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 3.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 18}
  Your Payoff: 10


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make a decision for this round, let's carefully analyze the outcome of the previous round and evaluate each route.

**Previous Round Analysis**:
- You chose Route O-L-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The route distribution was: 18 drivers chose O-L-D.
- With 18 drivers on O-L-D, the cost was 10X + 210, where X = 18, resulting in a total cost of 390. Subtracting this from the 400 endowment gives a payoff of 10.

**Assessing Each Route**:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 210
   - With everyone choosing O-L-D last round, it has become highly congested, driving costs to almost maximum.
   - This high level of participation is unsustainable for optimizing payoffs in the future.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 10Y
   - Not chosen last round, indicating potential for lower costs assuming similar trends, but with the risk of others gravitating towards it.
   - Dormancy suggests that shifting to this route could capitalize on low engagement for better outcomes.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost = 210 + 10Y
   - This route wasn't chosen either, creating an opportunity similar to O-L-R-D, provided congestion remains absent.
   - The predictability of costs, due to the fixed segment, might yield a better payoff if others haven't switched to it.

**Considerations**:
- The crowding effect on O-L-D created an enormous cost, suggesting the need to divert to less congested paths.
- Both O-L-R-D and O-R-D remained unselected, providing a blank slate opportunity for reducing travel costs by avoiding existing excess.

**Strategy Decision**:
- It’s advantageous to shift towards a less congested route to reduce costs. The challenge lies in predicting potential shifts by others.
- There seems good potential in Route O-R-D due to its previously minimal participation and fixed section.

Thus, the decision is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 3.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 12, 'O-L-R-D': 6}
  Your Payoff: 10


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make an informed decision for this round, it’s crucial to analyze the previous round's outcome and re-evaluate each available route option.

**Previous Round Analysis**:
- You chose Route O-R-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The route distribution was: 12 drivers on O-R-D and 6 on O-L-R-D.
- With 12 drivers on O-R-D, the cost was 210 + 10Y, where Y = 12, resulting in a total cost of 330. Subtracting from the 400 endowment, the payoff of 70 seems off, indicating the need to reassess strategic choice in handling uncertainties.

**Assessing Each Route**:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 210
   - Last used with high congestion previously, which might deter some participants now who faced high costs.
   - Could be explored again if participation remains low, reducing variable costs.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 10Y
   - With 6 drivers choosing last round, moderate congestion was noted, potentially leading to lower costs than O-R-D.
   - Its use signifies players are considering alternatives, so it might balance out next depending on others' choices.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost = 210 + 10Y
   - High congestion with 12 participants last round, indicating that cost spikes due to variable component, resulting in low payoff.
   - Need for moving away from current majority prevents cost loop.

**Considerations**:
- Crowding on the selected route produced high costs, meaning exploring less crowded paths is critical.
- O-L-R-D, seeing moderate use, might hit a fluctuating stage balancing congestion versus cost-effectiveness.

**Strategy Decision**:
- Given the last outcome, a switch is crucial to avoid repeating similar cost pitfalls.
- Considering that O-L-D could now see a reduction in participant number while striking potential balance in the cost, exploring this prospect is instrumental in optimizing.

Thus, the decision is:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 3.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 14, 'O-L-R-D': 4}
  Your Payoff: 10


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Based on the results from the previous rounds, let's re-evaluate each route option and determine a strategic choice that may help optimize the outcome.

**Previous Round Analysis**:
- You chose Route O-L-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The route distribution was: 14 drivers on O-L-D and 4 on O-L-R-D.
- With 14 drivers on O-L-D, the cost was 10X + 210, where X = 14, resulting in a total cost of 350. Subtracting from the 400 endowment gives a payoff of 50, suggesting the payoff calculation impacted score.

**Assessing Each Route**:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 210
   - High participation of 14 drivers led to significant congestion and resultant high costs.
   - Continued use by many participants demands evaluating alternative paths to avoid repeated costs.

2. **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 10Y
   - With 4 drivers, this route was less congested, making it possible to have handled overall costs better than O-L-D or O-R-D.
   - Lower participation implies potential for lower costs if the trend stays moderate.

3. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost = 210 + 10Y
   - Was not chosen last round, presenting an unexplored opportunity this time around.
   - An opportunity to leverage lower engagement to navigate around high-cost pitfalls.

**Considerations**:
- The majority opting for a single route incurs prohibitive costs, indicating value in opting for less traveled options.
- Switching to undervalued paths presents an opportunity to minimize exacerbating cost impacts stemming from congestion.

**Strategy Decision**:
- Route O-L-R-D presents a possible strategy if it continues to experience moderate use, potentially allowing for balanced costs.
- Exploring Route O-R-D as a less engaged option offers a chance to minimize exposure to shared variable costs.

Thus, the decision is:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 13, 'O-L-R-D': 5}
  Your Payoff: 10


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To decide on the optimal route for this round, let's analyze the recent outcome and evaluate the potential of each route option.

**Previous Round Analysis**:
- You chose Route O-R-D and received a payoff of 10.
- The route distribution was: 13 drivers on O-R-D and 5 on O-L-R-D.
- With 13 drivers on O-R-D, the cost was 210 + 10Y, where Y = 13, resulting in a total cost of 340. Subtracting from the 400 endowment, typically provides a payoff of 60, but factors seem to extend beyond apparent deductions.

**Assessing Each Route**:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 210
   - Previously avoided, yet participation might be low as congestion deters choices; unused paths sometimes allow leveraging minimal congestion for better cost.
