System Message: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To decide which route to select in order to minimize the travel cost and maximize the payoff, I will analyze the cost structure of both available routes.

### Route Analysis

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost = 10 * X + 210
   - The cost is dependent on the number of drivers, X, choosing this route.

2. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost = 210 + 10 * Y
   - Similarly, this cost is dependent on the number of drivers, Y, choosing this route.

### Strategic Choice

- **Goal:** Minimize travel cost in order to maximize the difference between the endowment (400 points) and travel cost. This effectively maximizes the payoff.

- **Key Consideration:** 
  - The more participants choose a particular route, the higher the cost becomes due to the factor multiplied by the number of participants. 

- **Initial Assumption:**
  - Assuming the majority of participants might initially choose the O-L-D route because it has a variable factor at the very beginning, while O-R-D has a fixed cost at the start.

- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - Observe the trend of which route most participants are gravitating towards in the initial rounds.
  - Select the opposite route to avoid congestion and benefit from lower variable costs.

### Probabilistic Analysis
- If initial trends are unknown (as in the start), choosing O-R-D could be advantageous due to fewer participants expected at the start since most might avoid the fixed cost initially.
- If, in practice, it becomes evident that O-L-D becomes overcrowded, switching to O-R-D can minimize costs.

### Route Selection
Given these considerations, I will start by choosing the route O-R-D initially to potentially avoid initial overcrowding on the variable-cost-heavy route O-L-D.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 6, 'O-R-D': 12}
  Your Payoff: 70


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's analyze the results from the previous round and decide the optimal choice for the current round.

### Previous Round Recap
- **Your Choice:** O-R-D
- **Route Choice Distribution:**
  - O-L-D: 6 participants
  - O-R-D: 12 participants
- **Your Payoff:** 70
  
### Cost Calculation (Previous Round)
- **O-R-D Cost Calculation:**
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * Y
  - Y = 12 (number of participants on O-R-D)
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * 12 = 330
  - Payoff = 400 (endowment) - 330 (cost) = 70

- **O-L-D Cost Calculation (for comparison):**
  - Cost = 10 * X + 210
  - X = 6 (number of participants on O-L-D)
  - Cost = 10 * 6 + 210 = 270
  - If I had chosen O-L-D, my payoff would have been 400 - 270 = 130

### Analysis
1. **Current Preference:** The majority of participants (12 out of 18) are currently choosing O-R-D, making its cost high.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** Last round, O-L-D was less congested and thus cheaper, leading to a higher payoff for those choosing it.

### Strategy for Current Round
- **Switch to O-L-D:**
  - Given the current trend, switching to O-L-D is likely to provide a better payoff as fewer participants are using it. 
  - This will lower the cost on O-L-D and increase the payoff since it’s not as congested.

- **Expected Outcome:**
  - If choosing O-L-D attracts fewer participants (let’s assume X remains similar around 6-7), the cost will stay reasonably low.

### Decision
Based on these considerations, switching to route O-L-D is a strategic choice to avoid congestion and potentially higher costs on O-R-D.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 4, 'O-L-D': 14}
  Your Payoff: 50


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Based on the results from the most recent round, let's evaluate the situation and determine the optimal route choice.

### Previous Round Recap
- **Your Choice:** O-L-D
- **Route Choice Distribution:**
  - O-R-D: 4 participants
  - O-L-D: 14 participants
- **Your Payoff:** 50
  
### Cost Calculation (Previous Round)
- **O-L-D Cost Calculation:**
  - Cost = 10 * X + 210
  - X = 14 (number of participants on O-L-D)
  - Cost = 10 * 14 + 210 = 350
  - Payoff = 400 (endowment) - 350 (cost) = 50

- **O-R-D Cost Calculation (for comparison):**
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * Y
  - Y = 4 (number of participants on O-R-D)
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * 4 = 250
  - If I had chosen O-R-D, my payoff would have been 400 - 250 = 150

### Analysis
1. **Switch in Preference:** More participants (14 out of 18) chose O-L-D, leading to high congestion and costs on that route.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** O-R-D was significantly cheaper in the previous round with only 4 participants.

### Strategy for Current Round
- **Switch to O-R-D:**
  - Due to the high number of participants on O-L-D, reverting to O-R-D is advisable. 
  - This should reduce the cost, assuming O-R-D continues to attract fewer participants.

- **Expected Outcome:**
  - If the number of participants on O-R-D remains low (similar to 4-5), the cost will be significantly reduced, providing a higher payoff.

### Decision
To leverage the lower cost and higher potential payoff, selecting route O-R-D is strategically optimal for minimizing costs.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's evaluate the recent developments from the previous round and determine the best decision moving forward.

### Previous Round Recap
- **Your Choice:** O-R-D
- **Route Choice Distribution:**
  - O-R-D: 18 participants
  - O-L-D: 0 participants (implicitly understood as all chose O-R-D)
- **Your Payoff:** 10

### Cost Calculation (Previous Round)
- **O-R-D Cost Calculation:**
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * Y
  - Y = 18 (all participants chose O-R-D)
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * 18 = 390
  - Payoff = 400 (endowment) - 390 (cost) = 10

### Analysis
1. **Full Congestion on O-R-D:** In the previous round, all participants chose O-R-D due to its reduced perceived costs earlier, leading to extreme congestion and very high costs.
2. **Opportunity for O-L-D:** Since no participants chose O-L-D, switching to it should provide minimal congestion and therefore lower costs.

### Strategy for Current Round
- **Switch to O-L-D:**
  - With O-R-D experiencing extreme congestion, participants are likely to reconsider their choice.
  - Choosing O-L-D offers the potential for lower costs due to expected low participant numbers.

- **Expected Outcome:**
  - If fewer participants switch to O-L-D, the cost will significantly decrease compared to the fully congested O-R-D, thus providing a better payoff.

### Decision
To avoid the congestion and high costs seen on O-R-D, selecting route O-L-D appears optimal to potentially increase the payoff.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Based on the results from the latest round, let's evaluate and decide on the best strategy for the current round.

### Previous Round Recap
- **Your Choice:** O-L-D
- **Route Choice Distribution:**
  - O-L-D: 17 participants
  - O-R-D: 1 participant
- **Your Payoff:** 20

### Cost Calculation (Previous Round)
- **O-L-D Cost Calculation:**
  - Cost = 10 * X + 210
  - X = 17 (number of participants on O-L-D)
  - Cost = 10 * 17 + 210 = 380
  - Payoff = 400 (endowment) - 380 (cost) = 20

- **O-R-D Cost Calculation (for comparison):**
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * Y
  - Y = 1 (number of participants on O-R-D)
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * 1 = 220
  - If I had chosen O-R-D, my payoff would have been 400 - 220 = 180

### Analysis
1. **Shifting Preference:** The majority of participants switched to O-L-D, causing high congestion and costs.
2. **Opportunity with O-R-D:** With only 1 participant on O-R-D, it offered a much lower cost and a much higher potential payoff in the last round.

### Strategy for Current Round
- **Switch to O-R-D:**
  - As most participants crowded O-L-D, O-R-D should provide the opportunity for significant cost savings due to likely fewer participants.
  - Shifting to O-R-D, based on previous patterns, can capitalize on this.

- **Expected Outcome:**
  - If the overcrowding trend continues, and O-R-D remains less populated, the payoff should be significantly better than the crowded O-L-D option.

### Decision
To benefit from the likely lower congestion and costs, choosing route O-R-D will be strategically optimal to minimize costs and maximize payoff.

LLM Output: Let's carefully analyze the situation based on the results from the previous round to make an informed decision for the current round.

### Previous Round Recap
- **Your Choice:** O-R-D
- **Route Choice Distribution:**
  - O-R-D: 18 participants
  - O-L-D: 0 participants
- **Your Payoff:** 10

### Cost Calculation (Previous Round)
- **O-R-D Cost Calculation:**
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * Y
  - Y = 18 (all participants chose O-R-D)
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * 18 = 390
  - Payoff = 400 (endowment) - 390 (cost) = 10

### Analysis
1. **Complete Congestion on O-R-D:** Once again, every participant chose O-R-D, leading to maximum congestion and high costs.
2. **No Participants on O-L-D:** No one chose O-L-D, meaning it would have potentially offered minimal congestion and much lower costs.

### Strategy for Current Round
- **Switch to O-L-D:**
  - Given that O-R-D was completely congested, many participants might now consider switching. It's an opportunity to capitalize on reduced participants on O-L-D.
  - With O-L-D attracting possibly fewer drivers, the cost will decrease, leading to a potential for a higher payoff.

### Decision
Given the recurring pattern of overcrowding on O-R-D, it's strategically wise to switch to the less populated O-L-D route to improve the payoff.

### Previous Round Recap
- **Your Choice:** O-L-D
- **Route Choice Distribution:**
  - O-L-D: 17 participants
  - O-R-D: 1 participant
- **Your Payoff:** 20

### Cost Calculation (Previous Round)
- **O-L-D Cost Calculation:**
  - Cost = 10 * X + 210
  - X = 17 (number of participants on O-L-D)
  - Cost = 10 * 17 + 210 = 380
  - Payoff = 400 (endowment) - 380 (cost) = 20

- **O-R-D Cost Calculation (for comparison):**
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * Y
  - Y = 1 (number of participants on O-R-D)
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * 1 = 220
  - If I had chosen O-R-D, my payoff would have been 400 - 220 = 180

### Analysis
1. **Congestion on O-L-D:** Again, the majority chose O-L-D, resulting in high congestion and costs.
2. **Opportunity with O-R-D:** With only 1 participant on O-R-D, this route offered much lower costs.

### Strategy for Current Round
- **Switch to O-R-D:**
  - Since O-L-D has been overcrowded consistently, many participants may now rethink their choices.
  - Moving to O-R-D can leverage the likely change as participants adjust, considering its previously lower occupancy.

### Expected Outcome:
- If O-R-D continues to attract fewer participants, the payoff will significantly increase compared to the heavily populated O-L-D.

### Decision
To benefit from lower congestion and potentially higher payoff, selecting route O-R-D is recommended.

  - O-L-D: 3 participants
  - O-R-D: 15 participants
- **Your Payoff:** 40

### Cost Calculation (Previous Round)
- **O-R-D Cost Calculation:**
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * Y
  - Y = 15 (number of participants on O-R-D)
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * 15 = 360
  - Payoff = 400 (endowment) - 360 (cost) = 40

- **O-L-D Cost Calculation (for comparison):**
  - Cost = 10 * X + 210
  - X = 3 (number of participants on O-L-D)
  - Cost = 10 * 3 + 210 = 240
  - If I had chosen O-L-D, my payoff would have been 400 - 240 = 160

### Analysis
1. **O-R-D Congestion:** A significant number of participants chose O-R-D, leading to high costs.
2. **Opportunity with O-L-D:** With only 3 participants on O-L-D, it resulted in much lower costs and higher potential payoffs.

### Strategy for Current Round
- **Switch to O-L-D:**
  - Given the high number of participants on O-R-D, there is a strong opportunity to reduce costs by switching to O-L-D.
  - Such a change could lead to greater payoff if many participants decide to avoid the congestion they experienced on O-R-D.

### Expected Outcome
- If the number of participants on O-L-D remains low or even moderately increases, it can still provide a better payoff compared to the potentially high congestion on O-R-D.

### Decision
To take advantage of the likely reduced congestion and ensure better payoff, selecting route O-L-D is strategically optimal.

  - Cost = 10 * X + 210
  - X = 16 (number of participants on O-L-D)
  - Cost = 10 * 16 + 210 = 370
  - Payoff = 400 (endowment) - 370 (cost) = 30

- **O-R-D Cost Calculation (for comparison):**
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * Y
  - Y = 2 (number of participants on O-R-D)
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * 2 = 230
  - If I had chosen O-R-D, my payoff would have been 400 - 230 = 170

### Analysis
1. **Congestion on O-L-D:** A significant majority chose O-L-D, which resulted in high congestion and costs for this route.
2. **Opportunity with O-R-D:** With only 2 participants on O-R-D, it had much lower costs and would have resulted in a higher payoff.

### Strategy for Current Round
- **Switch to O-R-D:**
  - Given the extreme congestion on O-L-D, it is logical that participants may react by switching to O-R-D.
  - Attempting to choose the less congested route, O-R-D, should help minimize costs and maximize payoff.

### Expected Outcome
- If fewer participants use O-R-D, the payoff should be higher due to lower congestion compared to O-L-D.

  - Cost = 10 * 3 + 210 = 240
  - If I had chosen O-L-D, my payoff would have been 400 - 240 = 160

### Analysis
1. **High Congestion on O-R-D:** A substantial number of participants picked O-R-D, leading to significantly higher costs.
2. **Lower Congestion on O-L-D:** With only 3 participants choosing O-L-D, this route had much lower costs and would have resulted in a significantly higher payoff.

### Strategy for Current Round
- **Switch to O-L-D:**
  - Given the high number of participants on O-R-D, and the relatively low congestion on O-L-D, it would be strategic to switch to O-L-D to potentially reduce travel costs.
  - Participants are likely to react to the high costs on O-R-D by switching, which could balance or even reverse the congestion trend.

### Expected Outcome
- If O-L-D continues to attract a smaller number of participants compared to O-R-D, it can lead to a better payoff due to lower congestion and travel costs.

  - If I had chosen O-R-D, my payoff would have been 400 - 240 = 160

### Analysis
1. **Congestion on O-L-D:** A significant number of participants chose O-L-D, causing congestion and high costs.
2. **Lower Congestion on O-R-D:** With only 3 participants, O-R-D offered significantly lower costs and a better potential payoff compared to O-L-D.

### Strategy for Current Round
- **Switch to O-R-D:**
  - Considering O-L-D's higher number of participants and costs, it would be strategic to switch to O-R-D to likely encounter lower travel costs.
  - Participants observing the high costs on O-L-D may also reconsider their choices, potentially leading to a shift that would balance the route selection.

### Expected Outcome
- If O-R-D maintains a lower crowd, the resulting payoff will be better due to the reduced congestion and associated costs.

  - If you had chosen O-L-D, your payoff would have been 400 - 240 = 160

### Analysis
1. **Pattern Identification:** There’s a clear pattern where a significant number of participants consistently choose O-R-D, leading to higher congestion.
2. **Opportunity on O-L-D:** O-L-D consistently attracts fewer participants, resulting in lower costs and higher payoffs.

### Strategy for Current Round
- **Switch to O-L-D:**
  - Since O-R-D remains congested, switching to O-L-D offers a strategic advantage by providing lower costs.
  - Given past trends, O-L-D continually proves to be less occupied, leading to higher potential payoffs.

### Expected Outcome
- If O-L-D continues to have fewer participants, the costs will remain low, and the payoff will increase. Recognizing this pattern allows you to make a strategic move towards O-L-D.

### Decision
To maximize payoff, selecting the consistently less congested route, O-L-D, is strategically optimal.

  Your Payoff: 60


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's analyze the most recent data and strategize on the best choice for this round.

### Previous Round Recap
- **Your Choice:** O-L-D
- **Route Choice Distribution:**
  - O-L-D: 13 participants
  - O-R-D: 5 participants
- **Your Payoff:** 60

### Cost Calculation (Previous Round)
- **O-L-D Cost Calculation:**
  - Cost = 10 * X + 210
  - X = 13 (number of participants on O-L-D)
  - Cost = 10 * 13 + 210 = 340
  - Payoff = 400 (endowment) - 340 (cost) = 60

- **O-R-D Cost Calculation (for comparison):**
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * Y
  - Y = 5 (number of participants on O-R-D)
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * 5 = 260
  - If I had chosen O-R-D, my payoff would have been 400 - 260 = 140

### Analysis
1. **Current Trend:** A majority of participants chose O-L-D, resulting in some congestion and a lower payoff compared to the potential on the less congested O-R-D.
2. **Opportunity with O-R-D:** With only 5 participants, O-R-D provided a lower-cost route and higher potential payoff.

### Strategy for Current Round
- **Switch to O-R-D:**
  - The data shows fewer participants on O-R-D, creating an opportunity for reduced travel costs. 
  - Shifting to O-R-D could result in a strategically higher payoff if this trend continues or even balances slightly.

### Expected Outcome
- If participation on O-R-D remains relatively low, the cost will be significantly lower than heavily populated O-L-D, improving the payoff.

### Decision
To take advantage of lower congestion and potentially higher payoff, selecting route O-R-D is strategically viable.

  - Payoff = 400 (endowment) - 350 (cost) = 50

- **O-L-D Cost Calculation (for comparison):**
  - Cost = 10 * X + 210
  - X = 4 (number of participants on O-L-D)
  - Cost = 10 * 4 + 210 = 250
  - If I had chosen O-L-D, my payoff would have been 400 - 250 = 150

### Analysis
1. **High Participation on O-R-D:** A significant number of participants (14) led to overcrowding and high costs on O-R-D.
2. **Lower Participation on O-L-D:** With only 4 participants, O-L-D offered much lower costs.

### Strategy for Current Round
- **Switch to O-L-D:**
  - Given the high number of participants on O-R-D, switching to O-L-D is likely to result in lower travel costs and thus a higher payoff.
  - The previous trend suggests O-L-D has consistently fewer participants, which is advantageous.

### Expected Outcome
- With fewer participants likely on O-L-D, the costs will be lower, increasing the payoff potential compared to a crowded O-R-D.

  - Cost = 10 * 15 + 210 = 360
  - Payoff = 400 (endowment) - 360 (cost) = 40

- **O-R-D Cost Calculation (for comparison):**
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * Y
  - Y = 3 (number of participants on O-R-D)
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * 3 = 240
  - If I had chosen O-R-D, my payoff would have been 400 - 240 = 160

### Analysis
1. **High Participation on O-L-D:** With 15 participants, the route was significantly congested, leading to high costs.
2. **Lower Participation on O-R-D:** O-R-D had relatively few participants, resulting in much lower costs and a higher payoff potential.

### Strategic Decision for Current Round
- **Switch to O-R-D:**
  - Given the high congestion on O-L-D observed last round, switching to O-R-D is strategic to potentially reduce travel costs.
  - A trend reversal could lead many to choose O-R-D, yet it's likely fewer than on O-L-D given past patterns.

### Expected Outcome

- **O-R-D Cost Calculation:**
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * Y
  - Y = 15 (participants on O-R-D)
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * 15 = 360
  - Payoff = 400 (endowment) - 360 (cost) = 40

- **O-L-D Cost Calculation (for comparison):**
  - Cost = 10 * X + 210
  - X = 3 (participants on O-L-D)
  - Cost = 10 * 3 + 210 = 240
  - If I had chosen O-L-D, my payoff would have been 400 - 240 = 160

### Analysis
1. **High Congestion on O-R-D:** The repeated high number of participants on O-R-D is leading to significant costs and lower payoffs.
2. **Opportunity on O-L-D:** With consistently fewer participants, O-L-D continues to represent a lower-cost, higher-payoff option.

### Strategic Decision for the Current Round
- **Switch to O-L-D:**
  - To take advantage of lower congestion and costs, shifting back to O-L-D is logical given its consistent underutilization.
  - This choice leverages the favorable cost conditions on O-L-D as previously observed.

### Expected Outcome
- If O-L-D remains the route with fewer participants, selecting it will yield lower costs and potentially higher payoffs compared to O-R-D.

### Decision
To capitalize on reduced congestion and enhance the potential payoff, selecting route O-L-D is strategically sound.

### Previous Round Recap
- **Your Choice:** O-L-D
- **Route Choice Distribution:**
  - O-L-D: 15 participants
  - O-R-D: 3 participants
- **Your Payoff:** 40

### Cost Calculation (Previous Round)
- **O-L-D Cost Calculation:**
  - Cost = 10 * X + 210
  - X = 15 (participants on O-L-D)
  - Cost = 10 * 15 + 210 = 360
  - Payoff = 400 (endowment) - 360 (cost) = 40

- **O-R-D Cost Calculation (for comparison):**
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * Y
  - Y = 3 (participants on O-R-D)
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * 3 = 240
  - If I had chosen O-R-D, my payoff would have been 400 - 240 = 160

### Analysis
1. **High Participation on O-L-D:** The large number of participants on O-L-D results in high congestion and costs.
2. **Consistent Low Participation on O-R-D:** O-R-D consistently has fewer participants, resulting in significantly lower costs and higher potential payoffs.

### Strategic Decision for Current Round
- **Switch to O-R-D:**
  - Given the persistent pattern of overcrowding on O-L-D, switching to O-R-D can help minimize costs and maximize payoff.
  - Historically, O-R-D has been less congested, offering a cost advantage.

### Expected Outcome
- If O-R-D continues to have fewer participants, it will lead to lower costs and an increase in payoff compared to the crowded O-L-D.

### Decision
To avoid high costs and maximize potential payoffs, selecting route O-R-D is the optimal choice.

### Previous Round Recap
- **Your Choice:** O-R-D
- **Route Choice Distribution:**
  - O-R-D: 15 participants
  - O-L-D: 3 participants
- **Your Payoff:** 40

### Cost Calculation (Previous Round)
- **O-R-D Cost Calculation:**
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * Y
  - Y = 15 (participants on O-R-D)
  - Cost = 210 + 10 * 15 = 360

  - Cost = 10 * X + 210
  - X = 3 (participants on O-L-D)
  - Cost = 10 * 3 + 210 = 240
  - If I had chosen O-L-D, my payoff would have been 400 - 240 = 160

### Analysis
1. **Consistent Overcrowding on O-R-D:** Routinely high participation on O-R-D leads to high congestion and costs.
2. **Opportunity on O-L-D:** Fewer participants on O-L-D consistently lead to lower costs and higher potential payoffs.

### Strategy and Decision for Current Round
- **Switch to O-L-D:**
  - Considering the consistent pattern where O-R-D is crowded, switching to O-L-D is strategically advantageous.
  - O-L-D presents less congestion, indicating potential for reduced costs and increased payoff.

### Expected Outcome
- If the pattern holds and O-L-D continues to attract fewer participants, the route should offer lower costs and better payoffs.

### Decision
To maximize the payoff by choosing the less congested route, selecting O-L-D is strategically optimal.
