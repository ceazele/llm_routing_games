System Message: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make the decision, let's analyze each route carefully.

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost function: \(10X + 210\).
   - Here, \(X\) is the number of drivers who choose Route O-L-D.
   - The variable cost is dependent on the number of drivers selecting this route. If more drivers choose this route, the cost increases proportionally.

2. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost function: \(210 + 10Y\).
   - Here, \(Y\) is the number of drivers who choose Route O-R-D.
   - Similar to the first route, the cost increases as more drivers choose it, but it starts with a fixed base cost.

**Considerations:**

- Both routes have a cost structure that combines fixed and variable components. The fixed cost for each segment L-D and O-R is 210.
- The choice heavily depends on predicting the choices of other 17 drivers. Ideally, you want to pick a route that fewer drivers choose to minimize the multiplied cost component (10X or 10Y).
  
**Strategy:**

- If you expect more drivers to choose O-R-D due to its fixed cost appeal, then choosing O-L-D might be beneficial if you believe few will pick it.
- Conversely, if you predict hesitancy in choosing O-R-D due to its higher initial cost (210), then opting for it is wise if O-L-D seems to congest.

In practice, since all drivers might think similarly, it’s crucial to strike a balance and potentially alternate strategies over the 40 rounds. For simplicity in this initial decision without previous round data:

Let's choose Route **O-R-D**, banking on fewer drivers opting it due to its fixed starting cost.

Here's the decision in the required format:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 13, 'O-L-D': 5}
  Your Payoff: 60


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Based on the previous round's data, let's analyze and decide on the optimal route for the next round.

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your previous choice was **O-R-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution was: O-R-D had 13 drivers, and O-L-D had 5 drivers.
   - Your payoff was 60 points, which implies a relatively high travel cost because:
     - \( 400 - (\text{210 + 10 * 13}) = 400 - 340 = 60 \)
     - The high number of 13 drivers choosing O-R-D increased the variable cost significantly.
   
2. **Analysis:**
   - Route O-R-D had more drivers, hence a high additional cost due to congestion (10 * 13).
   - Route O-L-D had fewer drivers, which resulted in a lower variable cost:
     - Cost for O-L-D would have been \( (10 * 5) + 210 = 260 \), yielding a payoff of 140 points (400 - 260).
   
3. **Predictive Strategy for Current Round:**
   - Given the payoff and distribution, drivers may realize O-R-D was congested and could shift to O-L-D to reduce costs.
   - It’s likely that the number of drivers choosing O-L-D will increase this round as others aim to minimize their costs.

4. **Decision:**
   - Considering potential shifts and aiming for less congestion, opting for **O-L-D** could provide a better payoff, assuming fewer drivers switch than expected.

Here's the decision in the required format:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 0.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 17, 'O-R-D': 1}
  Your Payoff: 20


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's break down the situation based on the previous round's results and make a calculated decision for the next round.

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your previous choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D had 17 drivers, and O-R-D had 1 driver.
   - Your payoff was 20 points, which implies a very high travel cost because:
     - \( 400 - (10 \times 17 + 210) = 400 - 380 = 20 \)
   - Almost everyone chose O-L-D, drastically increasing the cost due to congestion (10 * 17).

2. **Analysis:**
   - Route O-L-D was heavily congested, resulting in very high costs.
   - Route O-R-D had only 1 driver, meaning its cost was minimal:
     - Cost for O-R-D would have been \( 210 + (10 \times 1) = 220 \), yielding a theoretical payoff of 180 points (400 - 220).
   
3. **Predictive Strategy for Current Round:**
   - Given the last round's congestion on O-L-D, it's likely many drivers will consider switching to O-R-D to avoid high costs.
   - It is a dynamic environment where many will try to avoid repeating the mistake of overloading O-L-D.

4. **Decision:**
   - To minimize potential overcrowding and maximize payoff, select **O-R-D** in anticipation of fewer drivers choosing it as others might move from overburdened O-L-D.

Here's the decision in the required format:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 0.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 18}
  Your Payoff: 10


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Based on the results from the previous round, let's carefully consider the decision for this upcoming round.

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your previous choice was **O-R-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-R-D had all 18 drivers.
   - Your payoff was 10 points, implying an extremely high travel cost:
     - \( 400 - (210 + 10 \times 18) = 400 - 390 = 10 \)
   - Complete congestion on O-R-D resulted in a maximum cost for the route (10 * 18).

2. **Analysis:**
   - Both last rounds resulted in similar congestion patterns when switching between the routes.
   - O-R-D was fully congested, leading to very low payoffs.
   - The opposite route, O-L-D, would look more appealing now, as it likely had no drivers (0 cost on X).

3. **Predictive Strategy for Current Round:**
   - Given the complete congestion on O-R-D, many drivers will likely consider switching to O-L-D to avoid high costs.
   - Predicting the actions of others is key: anticipate a movement towards O-L-D, but how significant is the switch?
   - Historically, drivers will attempt to distribute themselves evenly to minimize costs.

4. **Decision:**
   - To potentially benefit from minimal congestion and maximize payoff, my strategy will be to choose **O-L-D**, aiming that this time fewer drivers crowd it and more move to distribute evenly.

Here's the decision in the required format:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 0.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 18}
  Your Payoff: 10


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Based on the outcome of the previous round, we need to adapt our strategy and make a more informed decision for this round.

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your previous choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D had all 18 drivers, leading to extreme congestion.
   - Your payoff was 10 points which is indicative of the maximum travel cost:
     - \( 400 - (10 \times 18 + 210) = 400 - 390 = 10 \)
   - Complete congestion on O-L-D, with everyone selecting the same route, maximized costs.

2. **Analysis:**
   - Both O-R-D and O-L-D have been fully congested in recent rounds.
   - A pattern of overcompensation and shifts between the two routes has emerged: drivers are choosing the opposite route after each congested round.
   - This leads to significant congestion on one route and almost no usage on the other.

3. **Predictive Strategy for Current Round:**
   - It's likely that drivers will react to the previous congestion on O-L-D by shifting to O-R-D, expecting fewer people to be there.
   - Take advantage of the repetitive pattern: when one route is severely congested, many will likely swap to the other route in the next round.

4. **Decision:**
   - Opt for **O-R-D**, anticipating a reduced number of drivers, as others might attempt to avoid the densely populated O-L-D based on prior experiences.

Here is the decision in the required format:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

  Your Payoff: 10


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the persistent pattern of congestion, it's essential to adapt strategically to potentially reset expectations and break this pattern. Here's how to analyze and make a decision:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your previous choice was **O-R-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-R-D had all 18 drivers again, mirroring the congestion seen previously on O-L-D.
   - Your payoff was 10 points, indicating maximum possible cost due to full congestion:
     - \( 400 - (210 + 10 \times 18) = 400 - 390 = 10 \)

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The recent rounds illustrate a back-and-forth pattern where all drivers switch to the route opposite of the last congested route.
   - This swing leads to full congestion on the chosen route in each round.

3. **Predictive Strategy for Current Round:**
   - Anticipating that other drivers are also observing this pattern, they may choose to switch to **O-L-D** this time.
   - To mitigate risk, consider that although everyone might expect a switch, collective realization could lead to unexpected decisions.

4. **Decision:**
   - Opt for **O-L-D**, predicting that drivers moving away from the congested route may reduce total usage sufficiently to improve your payoff compared to another round of high congestion.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Based on the outcomes and patterns of previous rounds, let's carefully consider the best decision for the upcoming round.

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your previous choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D had 17 drivers, showing high congestion once again.
   - O-R-D had only 1 driver, indicating minimal usage and low cost.
   - Your payoff was 20 points, which is very low:
     - \( 400 - (10 \times 17 + 210) = 400 - 380 = 20 \)

2. **Analysis:**
   - In rounds where everyone switches routes expecting relief from congestion, one route remains almost unused.
   - O-L-D was heavily congested while O-R-D was almost empty, which provided a low-cost opportunity.

3. **Predictive Strategy for Current Round:**
   - Given the congestion on O-L-D last round, many drivers will likely attempt to switch to O-R-D to lower their cost.
   - Recognizing the alternating pattern, anticipate that some drivers might expect others to stay, offering a chance for fewer people on O-R-D.
   
4. **Decision:**
   - To maximize your payoff, choose **O-R-D**, anticipating that fewer drivers will predict this move after seeing O-L-D was congested.

  Your Payoff: 20


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the persistent pattern and the results from the previous rounds, let's analyze the situation and make a strategic decision for the upcoming round.

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your previous choice was **O-R-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-R-D had 17 drivers. This resulted in high congestion on O-R-D.
   - O-L-D had only 1 driver, suggesting it wasn't congested.
   - Your payoff was 20 points, which indicates high travel costs:
     - \( 400 - (210 + 10 \times 17) = 400 - 380 = 20 \)

2. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - We're seeing a continued pattern where the majority of drivers are selecting the route that was perceived to be less congested in the previous round, leading to that route becoming congested the next round.
   - Drivers have repeatedly alternated, trying to avoid congestion but ending up congregating on the same route due to collective shifts.

3. **Predictive Strategy for Current Round:**
   - After the heavy congestion on O-R-D, many drivers will likely seek to switch to O-L-D to avoid the high costs.
   - To predict accurately: assume that other drivers will notice the trend and may hesitate to switch back to O-L-D, especially if expecting others will do the same.
   
4. **Decision:**
   - Choose **O-L-D**, predicting that not everyone shifts expectations to the opposite route and it might be less congested this time.

  Your Payoff: 20


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make an informed decision for this next round, let's go through the available information step-by-step:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your previous choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution was primarily on O-L-D with 17 drivers, indicating high congestion.
   - O-R-D had only 1 driver, showing it was relatively free of congestion.
   - Your payoff was 20 points, signifying high travel costs: 
     - \( 400 - (10 \times 17 + 210) = 400 - 380 = 20 \)

2. **Current Pattern Analysis:**
   - Alternating congestion between O-L-D and O-R-D is evident, as drivers collectively switch routes to avoid congestion.
   - Usually, the switch is almost complete or very heavily skewed towards the less congested route from the prior round.

3. **Predictive Strategy for Current Round:**
   - Given that O-L-D was heavily congested, many drivers will likely attempt to switch to O-R-D this round.
   - Predicting collective behavior suggests going against the prior heavily congested route can yield better payoffs as majority of drivers move away.
   - It is reasonable to expect a shift back to O-R-D, thus O-L-D may end up being less congested.

4. **Decision:**
   - Opt for **O-R-D**, as drivers respond to congestion patterns by shifting routes and potentially reducing their numbers on this route compared to the previous round.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the results from previous rounds, let's examine the current situation and determine the best course of action.

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your previous choice was **O-R-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-R-D had 17 drivers and O-L-D had only 1 driver.
   - Your payoff was 20 points due to high travel costs stemming from congestion on O-R-D:
     - \( 400 - (210 + 10 \times 17) = 400 - 380 = 20 \).

2. **Analysis of Trends:**
   - There is a clear trend of alternating full congestion, where drivers collectively switch to the route perceived as less congested from the previous round.
   - Drivers seem to react in a coordinated way, resulting in consistently congested routes after each switch.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - After heavy congestion on O-R-D last round, drivers will likely consider switching to O-L-D, anticipating fewer drivers there.
   - Since everyone might anticipate a mass switch, it's critical to think about potential over-corrections: some drivers staying on O-R-D to benefit.
   
4. **Decision:**
   - Choose **O-L-D** with the expectation that many will switch after the observed congestion, anticipating lower congestion on O-L-D compared to the heavily used O-R-D from the last round.

LLM Output: Given the consistent congestion patterns, let's re-evaluate and make an informed choice for the next round:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D was chosen by 17 drivers, leading to high congestion.
   - O-R-D was chosen by only 1 driver, indicating that it was nearly free of congestion.
   - Your payoff was 20 points, owing to high travel costs from congestion:
     - \( 400 - (10 \times 17 + 210) = 400 - 380 = 20 \).

2. **Pattern Observation:**
   - There is a strong, established pattern of significant over-compensation between routes.
   - Drivers collectively switch en masse to the route perceived as less congested from the previous round, leading to predictable alternation.

3. **Predictive Strategy for Current Round:**
   - After observing O-L-D's congestion, drivers are likely to swing back to O-R-D.
   - The challenge is anticipating if this pattern will hold or if drivers will try to outguess the system by staying put or partially shifting.

4. **Strategic Decision:**
   - Opt for **O-R-D**, anticipating the regular swing back as drivers aim to avoid congestion from the last round's heavily chosen route.
   - By joining O-R-D, the expectation is that fewer drivers will likely crowd it this time after the pattern reveals itself.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the consistent results and trends over the past several rounds, let's carefully consider the strategic decision for this round.

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-R-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-R-D had 17 drivers, leading to high congestion and costs.
   - O-L-D was chosen by only 1 driver, indicating minimal congestion.
   - Your payoff was 20 points, resulting from high travel costs on the congested O-R-D:
     - \( 400 - (210 + 10 \times 17) = 400 - 380 = 20 \).

2. **Observation of Pattern:**
   - There is a clear and repeating pattern where drivers switch en masse to avoid the congestion experienced on the previously popular route.
   - This results in alternating rounds of heavy congestion on each route.

3. **Strategic Consideration:**
   - Based on past behavior, drivers are likely to move en masse to O-L-D in an attempt to avoid the congestion experienced on O-R-D.
   - However, given the repeating pattern, some drivers may anticipate this switch and stay to avoid sudden overpopulation on O-L-D.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - **Choose O-L-D**: Given the observed pattern, it's rational to switch to O-L-D this time, anticipating that others will avoid O-R-D this round following the congestion.
   - This choice hinges on the expectation that enough drivers will switch to lessen congestion compared to the prior round.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the outcomes from previous rounds, let's carefully evaluate the options and plan a strategy accordingly:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D was chosen by 17 drivers, leading to high congestion.
   - O-R-D was chosen by only 1 driver, indicating it was almost free of congestion.
   - Your payoff was only 20 points due to the high congestion:
     - \( 400 - (10 \times 17 + 210) = 400 - 380 = 20 \).

2. **Consistent Pattern Analysis:**
   - There has been a repeated pattern of alternating switches between the two routes based on assumed lesser congestion on the opposite route.
   - Drivers collectively shift to the route they anticipate will be less congested, resulting in predictable congestion on that route because of mass switching.

3. **Predictive Strategy for Current Round:**
   - Given the congestion on O-L-D, most drivers are likely considering a switch to O-R-D to decrease their costs.
   - Exploiting the repeat behavior can be beneficial: drivers focusing on avoiding last round’s congestion might cause O-R-D to become congested while O-L-D sees reduced usage.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-R-D**, as the assumption of a mass-switch away from last round’s congested route (O-L-D) may not materialize completely, reducing the congestion on O-R-D.
   - By choosing O-R-D, you can be positioned to benefit if the expected mass shift to O-L-D doesn’t entirely occur and more drivers than anticipated stay on O-R-D.

LLM Output: Let's systematically analyze the situation to make an effective decision for the upcoming round.

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-R-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-R-D had 17 drivers, again resulting in high congestion.
   - O-L-D had only 1 driver, indicating very low congestion.
   - Your payoff was 20 points, reflecting high costs due to congestion:
     - \( 400 - (210 + 10 \times 17) = 400 - 380 = 20 \).

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - Rounds have shown a persistent pattern where one route gets significantly congested while the other remains almost empty. The alternating pattern has drivers switching en masse to the route perceived to be less congested.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - Given the repetitive pattern of congestion, many drivers will likely switch to O-L-D after seeing O-R-D congested last round.
   - It's important to recognize this pattern and consider the collective mindset, which typically leads to overcompensation.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Opt for **O-L-D** this round with the expectation that a significant switch from O-R-D will occur, moving drivers away from the previously congested route.
   - By choosing O-L-D, you aim to benefit from the anticipated reduction in congestion as others flock to O-R-D to escape prior congestion.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's analyze the results from the previous round and strategize the next decision to improve the outcome:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D had 16 drivers, and O-R-D had 2 drivers.
   - Your payoff was 30 points, indicating some congestion:
     - \( 400 - (10 \times 16 + 210) = 400 - 370 = 30 \).
   - There was a slight reduction in congestion on O-L-D compared to prior rounds, but it’s still quite high.

2. **Current Pattern Assessment:**
   - We see a persistent pattern where the overwhelming majority continues to choose one route, leading to significant congestion.
   - More drivers on O-L-D, slightly fewer on O-R-D—though a small shift occurred, suggesting some drivers attempted to balance the distribution.

3. **Predictive Strategy for Current Round:**
   - Given the ongoing pattern, drivers are inclined to move in large numbers from the previous congested route (O-L-D) to the lesser-used route (O-R-D) the next round.
   - The reduced number on O-R-D might encourage more switches to it, expecting it to be less crowded now.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-R-D** anticipating that many drivers will move away from O-L-D due to its recent high congestion.
   - By selecting O-R-D, the goal is to capitalize on potential lower driver numbers there as others switch to remedy prior congestion on O-L-D.

Here's the decision:

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 16, 'O-L-D': 2}
  Your Payoff: 30


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Now, let's assess the situation based on previous rounds and decide how to proceed:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-R-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-R-D had 16 drivers, leading to significant congestion again.
   - O-L-D had only 2 drivers, indicating minimal competition and low congestion.
   - Your payoff was 30 points, reflecting the high cost of congestion:
     - \( 400 - (210 + 10 \times 16) = 400 - 370 = 30 \).

2. **Understanding the Pattern:**
   - We've consistently seen one route being heavily congested and the other barely used, showing drivers' tendency to switch en masse expecting less congestion.
   - The slight skew indicates a majority still elected the perceived "less congested" route, but the majority does not disperse adequately.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - Given O-R-D's congestion last round, many drivers will attempt to switch to O-L-D, anticipating a better payoff due to fewer users.
   - Expect collective behavior to once again shift towards the opposite route from last round’s congestion.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-L-D** this round, as drivers who experienced high congestion on O-R-D are likely to switch. This could leave O-L-D less congested relatively.
   - This choice banks on the anticipation of collective behavior driving others away from the overcrowded O-R-D.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
  Your Payoff: 40


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's evaluate the recent results and determine the best route choice for the next round:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D had 15 drivers, O-R-D had 3 drivers.
   - Your payoff was 40 points, which indicates heavy, but slightly reduced, congestion compared to previous rounds:
     - \( 400 - (10 \times 15 + 210) = 400 - 360 = 40 \).

2. **Observed Pattern:**
   - There's a trend where drivers shift in large numbers to what they perceive as the less congested route.
   - Though more drivers opted for O-R-D, the distribution was still heavily skewed towards O-L-D.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - With 15 drivers on O-L-D last round, many are likely considering switching to O-R-D for potentially less congestion.
   - Given this usual behavior, a significant switch could lead to congestion shifting to O-R-D while O-L-D might be less populated this time.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-R-D**, anticipating that fewer drivers might choose this route because of past heavy congestion on O-L-D, potentially evening out the distribution more.

  Your Payoff: 30


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's analyze the situation and determine the best route option based on the patterns and data from previous rounds:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-R-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-R-D had 16 drivers, leading to significant congestion.
   - O-L-D had only 2 drivers, indicating minimal congestion.
   - Your payoff was 30 points, which is lower due to the congestion at O-R-D:
     - \( 400 - (210 + 10 \times 16) = 400 - 370 = 30 \).

2. **Understanding the Patterns:**
   - The pattern consistently shows one route being heavily congested and the other underused.
   - Drivers are frequently switching to the route they think will have fewer drivers, but end up congesting that route instead.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - Many drivers are likely to switch to O-L-D, seeing that it had far fewer users in the last round and hoping to benefit from less congestion.
   - This presents an opportunity, as the collective mental model often leads to switching, potentially leaving the opposite route less crowded.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Opt for **O-L-D** this time, under the assumption that a mass move from O-R-D will happen due to past congestion. O-L-D is likely to experience reduced congestion as a result, offering better payoff potential.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To decide on the best route for the upcoming round, let's go through the analysis and consider the trends we’ve observed:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your prior choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D had 16 drivers, leading to notable congestion.
   - O-R-D had only 2 drivers, indicating it was largely unused with minimal congestion.
   - Your payoff was 30 points due to the congestion on O-L-D:
     - \( 400 - (10 \times 16 + 210) = 400 - 370 = 30 \).

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The pattern has been clear: drivers react by collectively switching to the route that had lower congestion in the previous round.
   - Both routes have alternately experienced significant congestion as drivers aim to choose the alternative to the previously crowded route.

3. **Predictive Strategy for Current Round:**
   - Given that O-L-D was heavily congested, drivers are expected to switch to O-R-D in hopes of better payoff due to less congestion perceived there.
   - Understanding this pattern of collective switching presents an opportunity to expect a smoother route based on alternating behavior.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-R-D**, expecting that others will find O-L-D’s past heavy congestion less appealing, thereby causing a shift towards it.
   - The goal is to leverage the predictable mass movement behavior to select the less congested route.

Here is the decision structured as required:

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 16, 'O-L-D': 2}
  Your Payoff: 30


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given this consistent pattern and previous results, let's consider the best decision for this round:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-R-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-R-D had 16 drivers, leading to high congestion.
   - O-L-D had only 2 drivers, indicating minimal congestion.
   - Your payoff was 30 points due to the substantial congestion on O-R-D:
     - \( 400 - (210 + 10 \times 16) = 400 - 370 = 30 \).

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - There is a clear, repetitive pattern where one route becomes congested because many drivers switch to the route that was less used in the previous round.
   - This alternating choice leads to consistent swings in congestion between the two routes.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - Given the congestion on O-R-D last round, many drivers will likely consider switching to O-L-D, expecting it to have fewer drivers.
   - Recognizing this behavior of collective switching can be advantageous to anticipate the lower congestion route.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-L-D** this round, as drivers who experienced heavy congestion on O-R-D are expected to switch to O-L-D.
   - This choice is based on the expectation that a noticeable shift away from the previously congested route (O-R-D) will occur, potentially balancing the distribution better.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make an optimal decision for this next round, let’s analyze the data and patterns we’ve seen so far:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your previous choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D had 16 drivers resulting in high congestion.
   - O-R-D had only 2 drivers, meaning it was largely free of congestion.
   - Your payoff was 30 points because of the congestion:
     - \( 400 - (10 \times 16 + 210) = 400 - 370 = 30 \).

2. **Observation of Pattern:**
   - We observe a pattern where most drivers switch to the route they think will have fewer people based on the last round’s data, often leading to congestion on that route.
   - Drivers have alternated consistently between the two routes based on seeking less congestion.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - After the significant number of drivers on O-L-D last round, many will likely opt for O-R-D this round, anticipating less congestion.
   - If drivers follow the usual pattern, they will choose the route that had fewer users the previous round.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-R-D** due to the anticipated shift away from the heavily used O-L-D.
   - The expectation is that the collective shift will move to O-R-D, but if not exhaustive, it should provide a better payoff than enduring congestion again.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the recent outcome, let's examine the data and decide on the most effective strategy for the upcoming round.

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your previous choice was **O-R-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-R-D had 15 drivers, showing significant congestion but a bit better than before.
   - O-L-D was chosen by 3 drivers, indicating low congestion.
   - Your payoff was 40 points, slightly better than previous heavily congested rounds:
     - \( 400 - (210 + 10 \times 15) = 400 - 360 = 40 \).

2. **Analysis of Trends:**
   - There is a frequent switching pattern, where drivers opt for what they believe will be the underutilized route based on the previous round's data.
   - Despite the reduced congestion on O-R-D, the shift was not as drastic as expected, possibly leading to more balanced distributions moving forward.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - Many drivers might notice the slightly reduced congestion on O-R-D and consider staying or sticking to gradual shifts.
   - Alternatively, drivers may decide to flock to O-L-D, assuming a lower turnout than the prior round, potentially reducing congestion on O-R-D.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Opt for **O-L-D**, anticipating that the reaction of other drivers to last round’s configuration can lead to congestion balancing, given that the switch could be less drastic and balanced this time.
   - This decision hinges on the assumption that more drivers will avoid O-R-D following its higher congestion pattern, resulting in a reduced load on O-L-D.

LLM Output: Based on the results from the last round, let's analyze and decide on the most suitable route for the upcoming round:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D had 15 drivers, continuing to show some congestion.
   - O-R-D had 3 drivers, indicating lower congestion.
   - Your payoff was 40 points, which is an improvement over past rounds but still not optimal:
     - \( 400 - (10 \times 15 + 210) = 400 - 360 = 40 \).

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - There's still a pattern of majority switching based on perceived less congestion from prior rounds.
   - While congestion experiences are reducing in severity, they still heavily influence driver decisions, leading to expected yet not extreme shifts.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - With a fair number on O-L-D last round, drivers might opt for O-R-D in an attempt to find a less crowded route.
   - Noticing the modest congestion, it’s plausible that the route balance might stabilize or shift slightly as drivers spread out their choices.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-R-D**, as there's a chance that some drivers who experienced more congestion on O-L-D may shift, distributing drivers more evenly.
   - This decision leverages the expected behavior pattern where drivers adapt to prior congestion experiences.

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-R-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-R-D had 14 drivers, showing a tendency towards congestion, albeit less than before.
   - O-L-D had 4 drivers, indicating less congestion.
   - Your payoff was 50 points, which is an improvement:
     - \( 400 - (210 + 10 \times 14) = 400 - 350 = 50 \).

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The distribution of choices is starting to balance out slightly, although O-R-D still has a notable majority.
   - Drivers appear to be reacting more evenly, potentially shifting away from extreme swings.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - With O-R-D still holding a majority last round, drivers who previously experienced its relative congestion may consider shifting to O-L-D.
   - If the pattern of gradual rebalancing continues, a further shift towards more even distribution might occur.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Opt for **O-L-D** this round, expecting that some drivers may switch from O-R-D due to prior congestion, improving distribution balance.
   - This choice capitalizes on the adjustment phase in driver behavior, where drivers aim for a route with potentially fewer occupants.

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D had 14 drivers, indicating a significant level of congestion.
   - O-R-D had 4 drivers, suggesting much lower congestion.
   - Your payoff was 50 points, showing some congestion but improved balance:
     - \( 400 - (10 \times 14 + 210) = 400 - 350 = 50 \).

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - There is a slight improvement in distribution balance, but it still leans towards one route being chosen predominantly.
   - The situation suggests drivers are becoming aware of the need to balance the distribution across both routes.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - With the larger number of drivers on O-L-D last round, those experiencing more congestion there might shift to O-R-D.
   - Expect a potential correction in the form of more drivers moving to O-R-D where there was previously less congestion.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-R-D** to take advantage of the potential congestion reduction on O-R-D due to expected shifts from O-L-D.
   - This choice is based on predictions of continued redistribution efforts by drivers seeking to minimize cost.

     - \( 400 - (210 + 10 \times 14) = 400 - 350 = 50 \).

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - Consistently, segments have been overly chosen, leading to congestion.
   - Drivers are slowly adapting, but the pattern shows one route almost always receives more drivers, causing congestion.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - With 14 drivers on O-R-D last round, many might switch to O-L-D, anticipating it will be less congested.
   - Drivers are adjusting to more balanced distributions, yet some oscillation still exists.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-L-D** for this round, expecting that those who faced congestion on O-R-D will likely shift to O-L-D, potentially improving balance and payoff.
   - Anticipate that, following the trends and adaptations, the switch might help distribute numbers more evenly.

   - Your choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D had 13 drivers, showing significant use but less crowded than before.
   - O-R-D had 5 drivers, indicating it was less congested.
   - Your payoff was 60 points, which is better, likely due to some dispersal:
     - \( 400 - (10 \times 13 + 210) = 400 - 340 = 60 \).

2. **Observation of Trends:**
   - The distribution shows a shift towards better balance, with fewer extreme swings between routes.
   - Drivers are increasingly recognizing crowded routes and adjusting, contributing to more distributed traffic.

3. **Strategic Consideration:**
   - Given that O-L-D was chosen by more drivers, some might shift to O-R-D, maintaining or even improving balance.
   - The previously observed adjustments seem to continue, which might stabilize both routes further.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Opt for **O-R-D** this round, expecting that those who experienced more congestion on O-L-D may seek relief by switching to O-R-D, improving its utilization.
   - By choosing O-R-D, you capitalize on possible flow redistribution and achieve a better payoff through decreased congestion.

   - Route Choice Distribution: O-R-D had 16 drivers, leading to significant congestion.
   - O-L-D had 2 drivers, suggesting it was largely unutilized.
   - Your payoff was 30 points due to high congestion costs on O-R-D:
     - \( 400 - (210 + 10 \times 16) = 400 - 370 = 30 \).

2. **Observations of Patterns:**
   - The pattern remains consistent: drivers flock to the route perceived as previously less congested.
   - Heavy swings continue to create uneven distributions, resulting in one route often being near its congestion limit.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - With O-R-D heavily congested last round, many drivers will likely consider switching to O-L-D, based on its minimal use last time.
   - This predictable oscillation between routes opens the possibility for an improved situation on the balance of routes.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-L-D**, expecting that drivers fed up with congestion on O-R-D will likely move to O-L-D, aiming to utilize perceived lesser congestion.

     - \( 400 - (10 \times 16 + 210) = 400 - 370 = 30 \).

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The pattern of large swings in distribution persists, where drivers tend to switch en masse to the route perceived to be less congested in the previous round.
   - This behavior leads to ongoing oscillation between the two routes in terms of congestion levels.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - Given O-L-D's heavy congestion, many drivers are likely to switch to O-R-D in hopes of experiencing less congestion.
   - The behavior of switching due to previous congestion is predictable and a key factor in decision-making.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-R-D** this round, expecting the shift in driver preference towards O-R-D will reduce congestion on that route.

   - Your choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D had 15 drivers, suggesting significant congestion.
   - O-R-D had 3 drivers, indicating much less congestion.
   - Your payoff was 40 points, reflecting the congestion on O-L-D:
     - \( 400 - (10 \times 15 + 210) = 400 - 350 = 50 \).

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - There is a clear trend of players switching in large groups to the less congested route observed from the previous round.
   - This pattern suggests oscillation, where expectations about route choice adjustment often lead to alternate congestion.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - With O-L-D being more crowded last round, it is likely that many drivers will decide to switch to O-R-D to minimize their cost.
   - Consider the potential for another significant shift as drivers seek to optimize their outcomes.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Opt for **O-R-D** with the expectation that the previous congestion on O-L-D will drive a shift, potentially leading to a more balanced distribution.

Human: You are agent 0.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 16, 'O-L-D': 2}
  Your Payoff: 30


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make the best decision for the next round, let's analyze the current situation and recent trends:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-R-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-R-D had 16 drivers, indicating significant congestion.
   - O-L-D had 2 drivers, showing it was largely free of congestion.
   - Your payoff was 30 points, due to high congestion costs on O-R-D:
     - \( 400 - (210 + 10 \times 16) = 400 - 370 = 30 \).

2. **Pattern Observation:**
   - There's a consistent pattern of drivers moving collectively to the route perceived as less crowded based on previous round's data.
   - This leads to substantial swings, where one route gets congested and the other remains underutilized.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - With O-R-D being heavily congested, many drivers will likely switch to O-L-D to avoid high costs.
   - Historical oscillations suggest that drivers will tend to move to the opposite route of the last congested one.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-L-D**, expecting a shift in driver preference as they react to avoid the congestion on O-R-D.
   - This decision aims to capitalize on the predictable pattern of drivers attempting to distribute more evenly after experiencing congestion.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's carefully evaluate the situation and make an informed decision for this round:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D had 16 drivers, indicating high congestion.
   - O-R-D had only 2 drivers, showing it was largely unused.
   - Your payoff was 30 points, reflecting the high congestion costs on O-L-D:
     - \( 400 - (10 \times 16 + 210) = 400 - 370 = 30 \).

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - There is a continuing pattern of very large swings in driver choices, leading to congestion on whichever route is perceived as being less used in the previous round.
   - This pattern leads to alternating congestion between O-L-D and O-R-D.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - Given the significant congestion on O-L-D last round, it is likely that a large number of drivers will choose to switch to O-R-D, perceiving it to be the less congested option.
   - This behavior suggests a potential shift in congestion from O-L-D to O-R-D if many drivers follow this trend.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-R-D**, given the expectation that drivers experiencing congestion on O-L-D will switch, potentially balancing out the distribution better.
   - This choice aims to position you on the less congested route based on anticipated reactions from other drivers.

   - Your choice was **O-R-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-R-D had 16 drivers, indicating significant congestion.
   - O-L-D had 2 drivers, indicating it was largely unutilized.
   - Your payoff was 30 points, suggesting high congestion costs on O-R-D:
     - \( 400 - (210 + 10 \times 16) = 400 - 370 = 30 \).

2. **Understanding the Pattern:**
   - There is a predictable pattern of drivers collectively switching to what they perceive to be the less utilized route, based on previous congestion.
   - Drivers tend to react to congestion by making significant shifts, resulting in one route being heavily favored over the other round after round.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - With O-R-D being crowded last round, it is likely that many drivers will switch to O-L-D in hopes of finding it less congested.
   - This opens the possibility for O-R-D to be less congested if enough players switch away from it.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-L-D**, as it is expected that many drivers who faced congestion on O-R-D will switch routes, potentially redistributing congestion away from O-L-D.

LLM Output: Let's evaluate the current situation and strategize the decision for the next round:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D had 15 drivers, leading to some congestion.
   - O-R-D had 3 drivers, indicating it was less congested.
   - Your payoff was 40 points, reflecting a moderately congested O-L-D:
     - \( 400 - (10 \times 15 + 210) = 400 - 350 = 50 \).

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - There continues to be a pattern where drivers tend to switch en masse to a route perceived as less congested based on the previous round.
   - This often results in one route being favored significantly over the other, creating congestion cycles.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - Given the significant number of drivers on O-L-D last round, many may consider switching to O-R-D, expecting it to be a less congested option.
   - Predictable oscillation between routes may suggest a shift towards O-R-D.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-R-D**, as it is likely that drivers who experienced congestion on O-L-D will switch, potentially minimizing congestion on O-R-D.
   - This choice takes advantage of expected user behavior moving away from previously crowded routes.

     - \( 400 - (210 + 10 \times 15) = 400 - 350 = 50 \).

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - Historically, there has been a pattern where drivers shift to the less congested route, observed from the previous round's data.
   - This results in a cycling of congestion from one route to another as drivers overcompensate.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - With O-R-D being congested last round, many drivers are likely to switch to O-L-D, anticipating it to be less crowded.
   - Consider how drivers react to these congestion cues, typically leading to a more balanced distribution after heavy congestion.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Opt for **O-L-D**, expecting that those who faced congestion on O-R-D will seek less crowded conditions, potentially improving the payoff situation on O-L-D.
   - By choosing O-L-D, the objective is to leverage the anticipated switch away from the crowded O-R-D.

   - **Your payoff** was 50 points, reflecting moderate congestion:
     - \( 400 - (10 \times 14 + 210) = 400 - 350 = 50 \).

2. **Current Pattern Analysis:**
   - There is some improvement in the distribution of drivers, but O-L-D still sees more congestion.
   - Historical behavior shows drivers often move away from more congested routes to less crowded ones, based on previous experiences.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - With O-L-D seeing more drivers, participants who experienced congestion may consider switching to O-R-D.
   - Predict expected behavior that could lead to more evenly distributed drivers, as drivers react to minimizing their travel costs.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Opt for **O-R-D** this round. Given last round's congestion on O-L-D, drivers are likely to migrate to O-R-D seeking less competition.
   - The aim is to benefit from anticipated movements towards O-R-D, as it may offer a higher payoff due to reduced congestion expectations.

     - \( 400 - (210 + 10 \times 15) = 400 - 350 = 50 \).

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - A clear pattern persists where drivers tend to switch to the less congested route observed in the prior round, causing congestion to alternate.
   - Drivers react to previous congestion levels, often leading to swings in route choice.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - With O-R-D experiencing congestion last round, many drivers will likely consider switching to O-L-D to avoid this congestion.
   - Historical responses suggest drivers will aim to redistribute away from the crowded route.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-L-D** this time, as drivers who faced congestion on O-R-D may shift, aiming for better conditions on O-L-D.
   - By selecting O-L-D, you aim to capitalize on the expected relocation of drivers from O-R-D.

  Your Payoff: 30


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: In order to make the best decision for this upcoming round, let's consider the recent results and patterns:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - **Your choice** was **O-R-D**.
   - **Route Choice Distribution**: O-R-D had 16 drivers, indicating significant congestion.
   - O-L-D had 2 drivers, suggesting it was largely free of congestion.
   - **Your payoff** was 30 points, indicating high congestion costs on O-R-D:
     - \( 400 - (210 + 10 \times 16) = 400 - 370 = 30 \).

2. **Observing Patterns:**
   - Historically, there's an observed pattern where players switch en masse to the other route, perceiving it to be less crowded.
   - The alternation results in one heavily congested route while the other remains underutilized, cycling congestion between them.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - With heavy congestion observed on O-R-D, it's highly probable that many drivers will switch to O-L-D this round.
   - Given this switch, O-L-D is likely to experience an increase in drivers as people react to lessen their costs.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Opt for **O-L-D**. Drivers who faced congestion on O-R-D are likely to move to O-L-D, trying to reduce travel costs.
   - This choice aims to capitalize on the expectation of movement away from the more congested O-R-D.

Here is the decision in the required format:

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

System Message: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make an informed decision regarding which route to choose, let's evaluate each available route based on potential costs and strategic considerations:

1. **Route Analysis:**

   **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost formula: \(10X + 210\).
   - \(X\) is the number of drivers choosing any route involving the segment O-L (both O-L-D and O-L-R-D).
   - Pay attention to total users on segment O-L which impacts the cost.

   **Route O-L-R-D:**
   - Cost formula: \(10X + 0 + 10Y\).
   - \(X\) is the number of users on segment O-L.
   - \(Y\) is the number of users on segment R-D, which may include those choosing O-R-D.
   - The cost is reliant on congestion on both segments O-L and R-D.

   **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost formula: \(210 + 10Y\).
   - \(Y\) is the number of users who choose route segments involving R-D.
   - A fixed cost is included due to O-R segment with potential variable cost from congestion on R-D.

2. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - If many drivers choose a route starting with O-L in previous rounds, it might be congested, hence potentially higher costs for O-L-D and O-L-R-D.
   - Choosing O-L-R-D could be advantageous if O-L isn't heavily congested, leveraging potentially less congested R-D under balanced choices.
   - O-R-D could be preferable if fewer users are expected, minimizing costs due to lower \(Y\).

3. **Decision Methodology:**
   - Assess previous patterns regarding congestion.
   - Consider potential distributions of drivers to infer probable congestion levels.
   - Choose the route that offers lesser anticipated congestion based on previous trends and current understanding.

4. **Decision:**
   - Considering strategic analysis and aiming to avoid high congestion, let's opt for **O-L-R-D** for the following reasons:
     - It benefits if O-L isn’t exceedingly congested.
     - Explores less utilized segments, leveraging non-congested routes if others overutilize O-R-D.

Here's the decision in the required format:

```json
{"route": "O-L-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 0.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-R-D': 18}
  Your Payoff: 40


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the results from the previous round, we need to carefully reconsider our strategy:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your prior choice was **O-L-R-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution showed all 18 drivers chose O-L-R-D, leading to full congestion on both O-L and R-D segments.
   - Your payoff was only 40, implying very high travel costs:
     - Costs were \( (10 \times 18) + 0 + (10 \times 18) = 360 \).
     - With the endowment of 400, the payoff became 400 - 360 = 40.

2. **Analysis of Pattern:**
   - Given full congestion on O-L-R-D, drivers will now likely react by avoiding the heavily congested path.
   - Drivers might consider other routes to balance their costs.

3. **Predictive Strategy:**
   - Since O-L-R-D was heavily congested, drivers might choose O-L-D thinking fewer users will switch to it.
   - Choosing O-R-D could also be viable if drivers think others might avoid O-L routes altogether.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Opt for **O-R-D** to take advantage of congestion avoidance behavior by peers, assuming some drivers will avoid the previously overcrowded O-L segment entirely.
   - This choice could potentially leverage a lower usage on R-D if fewer drivers stick to this segment.

  Your Payoff: 50


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To determine the best route for the next round, let's break down the current situation and results of previous actions:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-R-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-R-D had 14 drivers, showing significant congestion on segment R-D.
   - O-L-D had 4 drivers, suggesting lower congestion on the L-D segment.
   - Your payoff was 50 points, indicating moderate congestion costs:
     - Costs for O-R-D: \( 210 + (10 \times 14) = 350 \).
     - Payoff = 400 - 350 = 50.

2. **Understanding Patterns:**
   - Majority choice for O-R-D suggests drivers are still shifting based on congestion expectations.
   - Seeing fewer drivers on O-L-D might imply potential underutilization of the L-D segment.

3. **Strategic Assessment:**
   - **O-L-D**: If fewer people choose this, the cost could remain low given L-D is less crowded.
   - **O-L-R-D**: Utilizes both congestible segments. Good if R-D congestion remains low.
   - **O-R-D**: Still popular, likely to maintain some level of congestion on R-D.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Opt for **O-L-D**: Anticipate drivers might continue the swing, switching away from R-D due to past congestion. O-L-D may offer reduced congestion on L-D if not many drivers shift.
   - This choice aims to take advantage of potentially fewer drivers choosing O-L segments, reducing overall travel costs.

  Your Payoff: 10


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Based on the outcomes from the previous round, let's methodically decide on the best route for the next round:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D had 13 drivers, and O-L-R-D had 5 drivers. This indicates high congestion on the O-L segment.
   - Your payoff was only 10 points, which is very low, reflecting the high congestion:
     - Costs for O-L-D: \( (10 \times 13) + 210 = 340 \).
     - Payoff = 400 - 340 = 10.

2. **Analysis of Congestion Patterns:**
   - The majority chose the routes involving O-L, leading to significant congestion on this segment.
   - O-L-R-D drivers also contribute to the congestion on O-L, despite different final paths.

3. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - **O-L-D and O-L-R-D:** Both heavily use the O-L segment, likely to be congested if many continue to choose them.
   - **O-R-D:** Might be less congested if drivers shy away from routes starting with O-L, aiming to minimize costs.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-R-D** to avoid the heavily congested O-L segment. Given the significant past congestion on O-L, drivers may realize the need to switch to O-R-D to improve outcomes.
   - This choice depends on utilizing the potentially underused O-R direct route as others respond to past crowding on O-L.

Here’s the decision formatted accordingly:

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 14, 'O-L-R-D': 4}
  Your Payoff: 10


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make a well-informed choice for the next round, we need to analyze what happened previously and project likely behaviors:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-R-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-R-D had 14 drivers, and O-L-R-D had 4 drivers, indicating congestion primarily on segment R-D.
   - Your payoff was only 10 points, highlighting high travel costs:
     - Costs for O-R-D: \( 210 + (10 \times 14) = 350 \).
     - Payoff = 400 - 350 = 50.

2. **Congestion Analysis:**
   - The majority chose routes involving R-D, leading to significant congestion there.
   - Route O-L-R-D utilization signifies congestion on both O-L and R-D for those choosing it, but less on L-R segment.

3. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - **O-R-D:** Persistently crowded if drivers don't shift expectations, maintaining congestion.
   - **O-L-D:** Could see less usage if others over-correct towards R-D, avoiding high congestion segments initially.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Diverts through L-R could lead to mixed congestion based on O-L and R-D usage, but less predictable.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-L-D**, anticipating that some drivers will switch from congested R-D, reducing the load on O-L.
   - This option is based on the anticipation that O-L segments might be less congested if others aim to avoid heavy R-D congestion experienced last round.

  Your Payoff: 10


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To decide on the best route for the upcoming round, let’s analyze the recent results and predict driver behavior:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D had 14 drivers, and O-L-R-D had 4 drivers, indicating significant congestion on the O-L segment.
   - Your payoff was only 10 points, which reflects high congestion on the O-L segment:
     - Costs for O-L-D: \( (10 \times 14) + 210 = 350 \).
     - Payoff = 400 - 350 = 50.

2. **Congestion Assessment:**
   - A strong preference for routes involving O-L has led to considerable congestion.
   - O-L-R-D usage also contributes to congestion on O-L, despite differing final segments.
   - Past patterns show that such routes repeatedly experience congestion when heavily chosen.

3. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - **O-L-D:** High congestion anticipated if drivers continue existing patterns.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Not preferred if aiming to avoid O-L congestion.
   - **O-R-D:** Likely less congested now as focus shifts to staggering results from prior rounds on O-L.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-R-D**, anticipating that congestion on O-L may make drivers seek alternative routes that bypass O-L completely.
   - This strategy banks on a lesser concentration on R-D as drivers who stuck to O-L options face unwelcome costs.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 15, 'O-L-R-D': 3}
  Your Payoff: 10


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the results from the previous round, let's carefully analyze the situation and decide on the most effective route for the next round:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-R-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-R-D had 15 drivers, indicating significant congestion on the R-D segment.
   - O-L-R-D had 3 drivers, which minimally used both segments but still contributed to congestion on R-D.
   - Your payoff was only 10 points, reflecting high congestion costs:
     - Costs for O-R-D: \( 210 + (10 \times 15) = 360 \).
     - Payoff = 400 - 360 = 40.

2. **Congestion Analysis:**
   - Heavy usage of O-R-D suggests that drivers are clustering in anticipation of avoiding congestion but ending up congesting R-D.
   - O-L-R-D users affect both O-L and R-D segments, though their numbers are smaller. 

3. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - **O-R-D:** Likely to be less congested if drivers decide to switch after experiencing high congestion.
   - **O-L-D:** Could attract drivers avoiding R-D after recent congestion, focusing initially on O-L's potential lower use.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Less predictable due to combined congestion potential but might remain less chosen if O-R-D takes priority shifts.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-L-D**: There's a high chance others will avoid O-R-D due to past congestion, potentially reducing O-L congestion if decisions balance out.
   - This plan leverages anticipation of shifts away from R-D, hoping that O-L-D remains under less pressure if people diversify choices.

Here is the decision formatted correctly:

  Your Payoff: 10


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the repeated results from previous rounds, let's evaluate the situation to effectively choose a route for the next round:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D had 14 drivers and O-L-R-D had 4 drivers, indicating heavy congestion on the O-L segment.
   - Your payoff was only 10 points, suggesting high congestion costs:
     - Costs for O-L-D: \( (10 \times 14) + 210 = 350 \).
     - Payoff = 400 - 350 = 50 (but seems to be miscalculated possibly due to additional congestion).

2. **Analysis of Congestion Patterns:**
   - Significant preference for routes starting with O-L has led directly to congestion in that segment.
   - O-L-R-D users also impact congestion on O-L before diverging at L-R.

3. **Considerations and Strategy:**
   - **O-L-D:** Likely to attract less attention next round if drivers expect ongoing congestion.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Involved if drivers assume others will avoid O-L-controlled routes indefinitely, though risks similar congestion.
   - **O-R-D:** A viable option as drivers might be discouraged from O-L, potentially see less use.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-R-D**, on the expectation that the crowd may avoid overrun segments and find this lesser-used route more attractive after experiencing recurrent O-L crowding.
   - By selecting O-R-D, the goal is to sidestep O-L congestion entirely, banking on a switch in driver choices to avoid routes seen as congested.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To maximize your payoff for the next round, let’s carefully break down the situation based on the results and anticipated behavior:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-R-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-R-D had 14 drivers, causing significant congestion on the R-D segment.
   - O-L-R-D had 4 drivers, indicating some use of the L-R route but also contributing to R-D congestion.
   - Your payoff was 10 points, reflecting high congestion costs:
     - Costs for O-R-D: \( 210 + (10 \times 14) = 350 \).
     - Payoff = 400 - 350 = 50 (there might be rounding or additional factors affecting actual payoff).

2. **Analysis of Congestion Patterns:**
   - Heavily used R-D segment due to a large number of drivers opting for the O-R-D route.
   - Some drivers also chose O-L-R-D, utilizing R-D, but the smaller group affects O-L instead of O-R at the start.

3. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - **O-R-D:** May continue to be congested if drivers believe the route is less crowded.
   - **O-L-D:** Could see increased usage, anticipating reduced congestion, but still a risk if expecting an O-L focus.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Less predictable due to mixed reliance on both O-L and R-D paths, higher uncertainty about congestion impact.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-L-D**, as drivers experiencing congestion on R-D might shift, reducing load on O-R-D. If expecting balance, fewer might risk O-L-D.
   - The strategy is to expect an adaptation where peers move from crowded paths, leaving O-L less used.

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D had 14 drivers, and O-L-R-D had 4 drivers.
   - This indicates significant congestion on the O-L segment due to a majority of players choosing routes that start with O-L.
   - Your payoff was only 10 points, reflecting high congestion costs:
     - Costs for O-L-D: \( (10 \times 14) + 210 = 350 \).
     - Payoff = 400 - 350 = 50 (Note: if this is not the reported payoff, there might be an error in calculation or oversight in conditions).

2. **Analysis of Congestion Patterns:**
   - There’s a notable congestion focus on the O-L segment due to the choices of O-L-D and O-L-R-D.
   - Players are clustering heavily at O-L, leading to substantial inefficiencies.

3. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - **O-L-D:** Continued congestion likely if drivers maintain expectation of less crowd than R-D.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Possible congestion on O-L but offers added uncertainty in payoff calculations.
   - **O-R-D:** Represents a chance to bypass O-L congestion if drivers assume shifts will stabilize load across paths.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-R-D**, based on anticipation that drivers will try to avoid the heavily clustered O-L segments. If expecting adaptation, fewer might risk starting at O-R.
   - This decision banks on a potential reduction in congestion given the past overwhelming focus at O-L.

   - Your payoff was 10 points, indicating very high congestion costs:
     - The cost for O-R-D was \( 210 + (10 \times 14) = 350 \), resulting in a low payoff.

2. **Analysis of Congestion Patterns:**
   - High usage of R-D suggests participants heavily favored O-R-D, leading to congestion.
   - O-L-R-D use contributes to R-D congestion, although its numbers are smaller with diversion from O-L to R-D.

3. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - **O-R-D:** Could remain crowded if drivers misjudge its congestion versus switches.
   - **O-L-D:** Anticipating a switch away from congested routes, it may attract drivers, though past congestion has been significant.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Could be less predictable, balancing effects of congestion on segments O-L and R-D.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-L-D**: With heavy congestion witnessed on R-D, some drivers may avoid it altogether, creating potential for the O-L-D path to be less congested if balancing occurs.
   - By selecting O-L-D, aim to take advantage of a possible redistribution of drivers as others adapt to prior path inefficiencies.

   - The R-D segment is heavily congested due to a majority choosing O-R-D and O-L-R-D routes.
   - High utilization of R-D shows that drivers were perhaps seeking a perceived less congested initial segment in O-R.

3. **Strategic Analysis:**
   - **O-R-D:** Likely to remain congested if players persist with R-D expectations.
   - **O-L-D:** Presents an opportunity if drivers shift to routes without R-D involvement after experiencing congestion there.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Also engages both critical segments, offering an uncertain congestion mix.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - Choose **O-L-D**, leveraging an expectation that many drivers may shift focus to avoid past congestion on R-D, resulting in lesser usage or balance.
   - This choice strategically avoids the R-D focus which appears overly intense, aiming for lower congestion on O-L-D if behavior adapts accordingly.

   - Choose **O-R-D**, reasoning that drivers having faced congestion on O-L might consider diverting to paths that avoid the problematic segment entirely.
   - This decision anticipates change in driver behavior, reducing participant load on previously congested routes.

Here's the decision:
```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 0.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 13, 'O-L-R-D': 5}
  Your Payoff: 10


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To navigate effectively through the next round, we must closely analyze historical patterns and strategize effectively:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - **Your choice**: O-R-D.
   - **Route Choice Distribution**: O-R-D had 13 drivers, and O-L-R-D had 5 drivers.
   - High congestion on the R-D segment led to significant costs.
   - **Payoff**: 10 points, indicating high congestion costs on the R-D:
     - Costs for O-R-D: \( 210 + (10 \times 13) = 340 \).

2. **Understanding Current Congestion Patterns:**
   - The R-D segment has been consistently congested due to many participants choosing routes that utilize this path.
   - Attempts to avoid O-L's congestion may be leading to fewer diversions to R-D, exacerbating R-D issues.

3. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - **O-R-D**: Likely to remain congested if drivers don't shift strategies.
   - **O-L-D**: Offers a potential relief from R-D congestion, as it avoids R-D entirely.
   - **O-L-R-D**: Involves shared congestion impacts due to paths connecting both major congested points (O-L and R-D).

4. **Decision-Making Strategy:**
   - Choose **O-L-D**, as drivers might now react to persistent R-D congestion by seeking routes avoiding this segment.
   - This choice capitalizes on potential redistribution away from continually crowded paths, potentially easing load on O-L starts.

LLM Output: To make an informed decision for the next round, let's break down the situation, consider the potential congestion on each route, and strategically choose the best option:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D had 13 drivers, and O-L-R-D had 5 drivers.
   - This indicates heavy congestion on the O-L segment.
   - Your payoff was 10 points, reflecting high congestion costs:
     - Costs for O-L-D: \( (10 \times 13) + 210 = 340 \).

2. **Understanding Congestion Patterns:**
   - Heavy use of the O-L segment indicates that drivers consistently choose routes involving O-L.
   - There is a pattern of congestion on this segment due to players not diversifying their route choices effectively.

3. **Strategic Consideration:**
   - **O-L-D:** Remains high risk due to predictable congestion.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Involves the congested O-L segment but shares end congestion impacts on R-D.
   - **O-R-D:** Offers an alternative avoiding O-L, which may lead to less congestion if drivers adapt away from their previous preferences.

4. **Decision-Making Strategy:**
   - Choose **O-R-D**, anticipating that drivers facing high costs on the O-L starts might consider shifting to O-R-D to find less congestion.
   - This decision leverages the likelihood of drivers changing behavior after experiencing repeated congestion, potentially changing route dynamics.

Here is the decision formulated in the required format:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 0.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D

  Your Payoff: 10


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make a strategic decision for the upcoming round, let's thoroughly evaluate the past outcomes and predict potential shifts in driver preferences:

1. **Review of Last Round:**
   - Your choice was **O-R-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-R-D had 13 drivers, and O-L-R-D had 5 drivers.
   - This reflects significant congestion on the R-D segment, with a high number of participants driving through it.
   - Your payoff was 10 points, indicating substantial congestion costs:
     - Costs for O-R-D: \( 210 + (10 \times 13) = 340 \).

2. **Analysis of Congestion Patterns:**
   - Continuous high traffic on R-D suggests a repetitive pattern where drivers might expect others to distribute evenly.
   - O-L-R-D, while fewer in numbers, also adds to the R-D congestion, affecting outcomes despite its split path.

3. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - **O-R-D**: Likely continues to see congestion unless participants significantly adjust their choices.
   - **O-L-D**: May present a non-R-D path opportunity, assuming other drivers adapt away from R-D.
   - **O-L-R-D**: Experiences shared congestion impacts from joint use of congested segments (O-L and R-D), being a less favorable mixed route.

4. **Decision Strategy:**
   - Opt for **O-L-D**, assuming drivers will react to R-D congestion by avoiding starting points that cue towards it.
   - This choice seeks to exploit potential strategic shifts away from the consistently congested segments, balancing traffic flow more effectively.

   - Your choice was **O-L-D**.
   - Route Choice Distribution: O-L-D had 13 drivers, and O-L-R-D had 5 drivers.
   - Heavy congestion occurred on the O-L segment.
   - Your payoff was only 10 points, indicating substantial congestion costs:
     - Costs for O-L-D: \( (10 \times 13) + 210 = 340 \).

2. **Understanding Congestion Dynamics:**
   - Persistent congestion on O-L suggests many drivers are not properly adjusting their choices despite previous high costs.
   - O-L is consistently chosen, leading to repeated inefficiency.

3. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - **O-L-D:** High likelihood of congestion continuing if patterns remain unchanged.
   - **O-L-R-D:** Engages the congested O-L, with additional R-D complexities, maintaining congestion risks.
   - **O-R-D:** A viable alternative if drivers decide to shift away from the common O-L starts to avoid congestion costs.

4. **Decision-Making Strategy:**
   - Choose **O-R-D**, anticipating that drivers, after consecutive rounds of congestion on O-L, might consider redistributing to paths that exclude initial congestion hotspots.
   - This approach banks on collective behavior changes aimed at congestion avoidance.
