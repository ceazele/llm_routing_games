System: 
You're David Wilson, a 50-year-old lawyer.
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you’ll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 5 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O A B D
Edges and associated costs:
Edge O to A, cost function: 10 * X
Edge O to B, cost function: 210
Edge A to D, cost function: 210
Edge A to B, cost function: 0
Edge B to D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-A-D', 'O-A-B-D', 'O-B-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-A-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-A to travel from O to A plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment A-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-B-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment B-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-A and B-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments A-D and O-B is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point S at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-A-B-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-A-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-B-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 X 4) + 0 + (10 X 15) = 190.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-A and 15 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment B-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-A-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 X 4) + (210) = 250, and each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-B-D will be charged a travel cost of (210) + (10 X 15) = 360.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
At the end of each round, you will be informed of the number of drivers who chose each route and your payoff for that round. 
All 5 rounds have exactly the same structure.


Human: The available routes are: ['O-A-D', 'O-A-B-D', 'O-B-D']
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```

AI: ```json
