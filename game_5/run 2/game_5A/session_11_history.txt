System Message: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To decide which route to choose in this traffic network game, we need to evaluate the potential costs associated with each route choice, taking into account both fixed and dynamic components of travel costs.

1. **Understanding the Cost Structure:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** The travel cost is 10X + 210, where X is the number of participants who choose this route. The 10X component varies according to traffic on segment O-L, while the segment L-D has a fixed cost of 210.
   - **Route O-R-D:** The travel cost is 210 + 10Y, where Y is the number of participants who choose this route. The segment O-R has a fixed cost of 210, and the 10Y component varies with traffic on segment R-D.

2. **Initial Considerations:**
   - If more drivers choose one route, the variable cost component for that route will increase significantly. The goal is to choose the route where the total cost is minimized.

3. **Strategizing Based on Predictions:**
   - Ideally, you'd choose the route fewer participants are expected to take, minimizing your variable cost component.
   - Given no prior data on participants' past behaviors, one potential strategy in early rounds is to choose the less appealing fixed-cost component as an hypothesis that might result in fewer initial participants, assuming most might aim for the route they perceive will be less congested.
   - Here, both routes have the same total cost structure at equilibrium when X equals Y since both result in a 400 cost (10X = 210, hence X = 21 if alone choosing O-L-D would make the segment costly).

4. **Risk Management:**
   - If most participants initially select the path with an assumed "less intuitive" lower overall assumed cost through group thought, congestion counteracts that assumption quickly.
   - Since O-R-D has the fixed cost up front, fewer may choose initially thinking the dynamic cost will save them; however, this could backfire if the mass opts predictably.
   
5. **Decision Making:**
   - Initially opt for a balanced route decision leaning on the quicker equilibrium offset by quick adjustments based on subsequent rounds learning. O-L-D initially has the potential for cost savings if hypothesis on pre-emptive balancing exists.

Based upon these considerations, and without specific knowledge about others' behavior but tailoring toward rational actions under uncertainty, my recommendation is to choose the route **O-L-D** for the first round. Future decisions would hinge on observed trends and play adaptability.

Human: You are agent 11.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Your Payoff: 120


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make a decision based on the summary of the previous round where you had a payoff of 120, we need to work backwards to see what that implies about the distribution of choices among the 18 participants.

1. **Calculate Travel Cost from Previous Payoff:**
   - You received an endowment of 400 points and your payoff was 120.
   - Therefore, your total travel cost was 400 - 120 = 280.

2. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-L-D:**
   - Since you chose route O-L-D, the travel cost you incurred was 10X + 210 = 280.
   - Solving for X gives: 10X + 210 = 280 → 10X = 70 → X = 7.
   - This means 7 participants, including yourself, chose route O-L-D last round.

3. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-R-D:**
   - Since there are 18 participants total, the number of participants who chose O-R-D last round is 18 - 7 = 11.

4. **Analysis:**
   - In the previous round, the O-R-D route was more congested with 11 participants, implying higher variable costs for those choosing it.
   - Your choice of O-L-D was a favorable strategy last round because it resulted in a lower dynamic cost component.
   - The payoff reflects a strategic choice since fewer users opted for O-L-D relative to O-R-D.

5. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - Knowing that only 7 chose O-L-D previously, O-R-D might still be perceived as congested, leading participants to switch, or others could now flock to O-L-D seeing the initial payoff.
   - Predicting behavioral adjustments, maintaining the O-L-D choice could be sound unless majority shifts cause inverse congestion.
   - Yet, tuning remains viable as individuals adjust, risk exists in both choices, but previous round pattern shows O-L-D slower adoption.

Based on these strategic considerations and the analysis of the previous round, a reasonable approach is to choose the route **O-L-D** again to capitalize on potential continued disequilibrium while readying to adapt based on new behavior patterns seen.

Human: You are agent 11.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Your Payoff: 50


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the previous round's summary where your payoff was 50, let's analyze what it implies about the distribution of choices:

1. **Calculate Travel Cost from Previous Payoff:**
   - With an endowment of 400 and a payoff of 50, your total travel cost was 400 - 50 = 350.

2. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-L-D:**
   - Since you chose route O-L-D, the travel cost you incurred was 10X + 210 = 350.
   - Solving for X gives: 10X + 210 = 350 → 10X = 140 → X = 14.
   - This suggests that 14 participants, including yourself, chose route O-L-D last round.

3. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-R-D:**
   - With 18 participants total, the number who chose O-R-D is 18 - 14 = 4.

4. **Analysis:**
   - The route O-L-D became highly congested last round with 14 out of 18 participants choosing it, leading to a significant variable cost.
   - O-R-D, with only 4 participants, likely resulted in a lower cost for those who chose it.

5. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - Given the high number of participants on O-L-D last round, there's a strong incentive for some to switch routes to O-R-D to avoid high variable costs.
   - Predicting a potential shift away from O-L-D due to its congestion, choosing O-R-D might result in lower travel costs if fewer participants opt for it again.

Based on these insights, switching to the **O-R-D** route for the current round seems strategic. This choice aims to leverage the expected reduction in traffic on this route and capitalize on the high likelihood of participants balancing the routes in response to last round's congestion.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Your Payoff: 20


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Based on the previous round's summary where you received a payoff of 20, let's evaluate the situation:

1. **Calculate Travel Cost from Previous Payoff:**
   - With an endowment of 400 and a payoff of 20, your total travel cost was 400 - 20 = 380.

2. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-R-D:**
   - Since you chose route O-R-D, the travel cost you incurred was 210 + 10Y = 380.
   - Solving for Y gives: 10Y + 210 = 380 → 10Y = 170 → Y = 17.
   - This implies 17 participants, including yourself, chose route O-R-D last round.

3. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-L-D:**
   - With 18 participants total, the number who chose O-L-D is 18 - 17 = 1.

4. **Analysis:**
   - The O-R-D route was extremely congested last round, with 17 participants choosing it, leading to a significantly high variable cost.
   - The O-L-D route had only 1 participant, suggesting a very low dynamic cost component for that route last round.

5. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - Given the extreme congestion on O-R-D and the low participation on O-L-D, many participants may now switch to O-L-D to escape high costs.
   - If others anticipate this and also switch, O-L-D could become congested again.
   - However, given the drastic imbalance last round, choosing O-L-D provides a reasonable expectation of cost reduction unless the majority dramatically shifts again.

Based on the above analysis, switching to the **O-L-D** route for the current round appears to be a strategic move. It anticipates a rebalancing of choices after last round's heavy congestion on O-R-D.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Your Payoff: 30


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the previous round's summary where your payoff was 30, let's deduce what this implies about the distribution of choices:

1. **Calculate Travel Cost from Previous Payoff:**
   - With an endowment of 400 and a payoff of 30, your total travel cost was 400 - 30 = 370.

2. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-L-D:**
   - Since you chose route O-L-D, the travel cost you incurred was 10X + 210 = 370.
   - Solving for X gives: 10X + 210 = 370 → 10X = 160 → X = 16.
   - This suggests that 16 participants, including yourself, chose route O-L-D last round.

3. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-R-D:**
   - With 18 participants total, the number who chose O-R-D is 18 - 16 = 2.

4. **Analysis:**
   - The O-L-D route was heavily congested last round with 16 out of 18 participants choosing it, causing high dynamic costs.
   - O-R-D, with only 2 participants, likely had low costs, making it a potentially more attractive choice now.

5. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - With the high congestion experienced on O-L-D, many participants may likely switch to O-R-D, expecting reduced costs.
   - If assumptions hold, fewer participants would mean lower variable costs on O-R-D this round.

Based on these considerations, switching to the **O-R-D** route for the current round seems to be a strategic decision. This choice is made with the expectation that participants will redistribute their choices following last round’s heavy congestion on O-L-D.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Your Payoff: 30


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Based on the summary where your payoff was 30 from choosing O-R-D, let's analyze and decide the optimal choice for the next round:

1. **Calculate Travel Cost from Previous Payoff:**
   - You received a payoff of 30 from a 400 endowment, implying a travel cost of 400 - 30 = 370.

2. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-R-D:**
   - The travel cost equation for route O-R-D you incurred was 210 + 10Y = 370.
   - Solving for Y gives: 10Y + 210 = 370 → 10Y = 160 → Y = 16.
   - Hence, 16 participants, including yourself, chose route O-R-D last round.

3. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-L-D:**
   - With 18 participants total, the number choosing O-L-D was 18 - 16 = 2.

4. **Analysis:**
   - The O-R-D route was significantly congested last round with 16 participants, causing high variable costs.
   - O-L-D, with only 2 participants, likely had lower costs and seems comparatively underutilized.

5. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - Expect an adjustment from other participants due to high congestion on O-R-D last round.
   - Based on typical dynamic adjustments, it’s probable that participants will switch to O-L-D to avoid past congestion.
   - Consider opting for the less-used O-L-D route for the upcoming round to potentially minimize costs.

With this analysis, switching to the **O-L-D** route is a strategic move aimed at taking advantage of the expected rebalancing in participant choices, ideally minimizing travel costs given last round’s congestion levels.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Your Payoff: 20


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the previous round's summary where your payoff was 20, we need to analyze what this means for the distribution of choices:

1. **Calculate Travel Cost from Previous Payoff:**
   - You received an endowment of 400 and had a payoff of 20, meaning your travel cost was 400 - 20 = 380.

2. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-L-D:**
   - Since you chose route O-L-D, the travel cost was 10X + 210 = 380.
   - Solving for X gives: 10X + 210 = 380 → 10X = 170 → X = 17.
   - This indicates that 17 participants, including yourself, chose route O-L-D last round.

3. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-R-D:**
   - Given 18 total participants, those choosing O-R-D would number 18 - 17 = 1.

4. **Analysis:**
   - O-L-D was extremely congested last round with 17 out of 18 participants, resulting in very high costs.
   - O-R-D, with only 1 participant, likely had significantly lower costs and represents a viable alternative.

5. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - Due to the previous congestion on O-L-D, many participants may switch to O-R-D to avoid excessive costs.
   - If O-R-D sees more participants, it's important to reevaluate competition there, but currently, it's underutilized.

Given these considerations, switching to the **O-R-D** route for the next round would be strategic. This choice capitalizes on the likely underuse of O-R-D from last round, potentially leading to lower travel costs.

LLM Output: Given the previous round's summary where your payoff was 20, let's analyze the situation to decide on the best route for the next round:

1. **Calculate Travel Cost from Previous Payoff:**
   - You started with an endowment of 400 and a payoff of 20, meaning your total travel cost was 400 - 20 = 380.

2. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-R-D:**
   - For O-R-D, the travel cost equation is 210 + 10Y = 380.
   - Solving for Y gives: 10Y + 210 = 380 → 10Y = 170 → Y = 17.
   - This means 17 participants, including yourself, chose route O-R-D last round.

3. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-L-D:**
   - With 18 participants in total, the number of drivers on O-L-D would be 18 - 17 = 1.

4. **Analysis:**
   - The route O-R-D was highly congested last round with 17 participants, leading to high costs on this route.
   - The O-L-D route, being chosen by only 1 participant, likely had much lower costs.

5. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - Given the severe congestion on O-R-D last round, it is likely that many participants will switch to O-L-D to avoid high costs.
   - Anticipating this shift, there may still be more participants choosing O-L-D compared to the previous round, but O-L-D is still potentially less congested compared to O-R-D.

Since O-L-D had only 1 participant last round, switching to **O-L-D** may provide an opportunity to benefit from lower travel costs, assuming not every participant adjusts simultaneously.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the previous round's summary where your payoff was 20, let's work through the analysis to determine the best route choice:

1. **Calculate Travel Cost from Previous Payoff:**
   - You received an endowment of 400 and ended up with a payoff of 20, indicating your travel cost was 400 - 20 = 380.

2. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-L-D:**
   - The travel cost formula for route O-L-D is 10X + 210 = 380.
   - Solving for X gives: 10X + 210 = 380 → 10X = 170 → X = 17.
   - This indicates that 17 participants, including yourself, chose route O-L-D last round.

3. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-R-D:**
   - With 18 total participants, those on route O-R-D would be 18 - 17 = 1.

4. **Analysis:**
   - The O-L-D route was heavily congested with 17 out of 18 participants, resulting in a significant variable cost increase.
   - Only 1 participant chose the O-R-D route, suggesting it had a much lower dynamic cost.

5. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - Observing the congestion on O-L-D, it’s reasonable to expect many participants will consider switching to O-R-D.
   - With O-R-D being underutilized last round, it could provide a cost advantage if relatively few participants switch.
   - The possibility of an overcrowded swap needs to be monitored; however, typically drastic changes balance over a few rounds.

With these insights, switching to the **O-R-D** route is a sensible move. It aims to leverage the likely underuse of O-R-D from the previous round, potentially leading to lower travel expenses.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Your Payoff: 20


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Based on the summary of the previous round with a payoff of 20 from choosing the O-R-D route, here’s the detailed analysis and decision-making process:

1. **Calculate Travel Cost from Previous Payoff:**
   - You began with an endowment of 400 and your payoff was 20, so your travel cost was 400 - 20 = 380.

2. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-R-D:**
   - The formula for the travel cost on O-R-D is 210 + 10Y = 380.
   - Solving for Y gives: 10Y + 210 = 380 → 10Y = 170 → Y = 17.
   - Thus, 17 participants (including yourself) chose O-R-D last round.

3. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-L-D:**
   - Given 18 participants in total, the number who chose O-L-D must have been 18 - 17 = 1.

4. **Analysis:**
   - Route O-R-D was highly congested with 17 drivers, resulting in extremely high variable costs.
   - Only 1 driver chose O-L-D, which suggests it had minimal congestion and lower associated costs.

5. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - Likely, many participants will switch to O-L-D to escape the high costs found on O-R-D in the previous round.
   - O-L-D seems underutilized and could still offer a cost advantage if the shift isn't massive.
   - It's crucial to consider that if too many participants switch, congestion could make O-L-D costly again.

Given these factors, switching to the **O-L-D** route for this round seems strategically advantageous, given the previous overuse of O-R-D and potential cost savings if congestion on O-L-D remains low.

2. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-L-D:**
   - Since you chose route O-L-D, the travel cost was 10X + 210 = 370.
   - Solving for X gives: 10X + 210 = 370 → 10X = 160 → X = 16.
   - Thus, 16 participants, including yourself, chose route O-L-D last round.

3. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-R-D:**
   - With 18 total participants, the number on O-R-D would be 18 - 16 = 2.

4. **Analysis:**
   - The O-L-D route was heavy with 16 participants, leading to high variable costs.
   - O-R-D, with 2 participants, likely had lower costs, making it an attractive alternative.

5. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - Given the high congestion on O-L-D, it’s reasonable to expect some participants will consider switching to O-R-D to reduce costs.
   - O-R-D was significantly less congested and may still provide a cost advantage this round if not too many people switch.

Based on this analysis, switching to the **O-R-D** route for the next round is a strategic decision to potentially minimize travel costs, assuming the congestion pattern shifts from the previous round.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Your Payoff: 20


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's analyze the situation based on the last round's summary, where you chose O-R-D and received a payoff of 20:

1. **Calculate Travel Cost from Previous Payoff:**
   - You started with an endowment of 400 and ended with a payoff of 20, meaning your travel cost was 400 - 20 = 380.

2. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-R-D:**
   - The travel cost equation for route O-R-D is 210 + 10Y = 380.
   - Solving for Y gives: 10Y + 210 = 380 → 10Y = 170 → Y = 17.
   - This indicates that 17 participants, including yourself, chose route O-R-D last round.

3. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-L-D:**
   - With 18 total participants, 18 - 17 = 1 participant chose O-L-D.

4. **Analysis:**
   - The O-R-D route was highly congested with 17 drivers, resulting in significant variable costs.
   - The O-L-D route was minimally utilized by only 1 participant, suggesting much lower costs.

5. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - Given the severe congestion on O-R-D, it's likely that many participants will consider switching to O-L-D to minimize their costs.
   - O-L-D should provide more cost advantages unless too many participants switch and increase congestion.

Considering these insights, switching to the **O-L-D** route for this round appears to be a strategic move. This decision anticipates a redistribution of choices aiming to benefit from the currently low use and potential cost savings on O-L-D.

   - You started with an endowment of 400 and ended with a payoff of 70. This means your travel cost was 400 - 70 = 330.

2. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-R-D:**
   - The route O-R-D travel cost formula is 210 + 10Y = 330.
   - Solving for Y gives: 10Y + 210 = 330 → 10Y = 120 → Y = 12.
   - Therefore, 12 participants, including yourself, chose route O-R-D last round.

3. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-L-D:**
   - Given 18 total participants, the number who chose O-L-D was 18 - 12 = 6.

4. **Analysis:**
   - Route O-R-D had moderate congestion with 12 drivers, resulting in a fairly good payoff.
   - The O-L-D route, with 6 participants, was less congested and could have offered better cost advantages.

5. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - Given the moderate congestion on O-R-D, some participants might consider switching to O-L-D seeking lower costs.
   - If several participants switch, O-L-D might provide even better cost savings, depending on the dynamics of the shift.

Based on this analysis, choosing the **O-L-D** route for the next round appears to be strategic. This decision leverages the potential decrease in congestion on O-R-D, allowing you to capitalize on the possibly lower congestion and costs with O-L-D.

LLM Output: Let's analyze the situation from the previous round where you chose O-R-D and received a payoff of 80. This will guide our decision for the next round:

1. **Calculate Travel Cost from Previous Payoff:**
   - You started with an endowment of 400 and ended with a payoff of 80. This means your travel cost was 400 - 80 = 320.

2. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-R-D:**
   - The travel cost formula for route O-R-D is 210 + 10Y = 320.
   - Solving for Y gives: 10Y + 210 = 320 → 10Y = 110 → Y = 11.
   - Therefore, 11 participants, including yourself, chose route O-R-D last round.

3. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-L-D:**
   - With 18 total participants, the number on O-L-D would be 18 - 11 = 7.

4. **Analysis:**
   - O-R-D had moderate congestion with 11 drivers, which resulted in a relatively high payoff.
   - The O-L-D route, with 7 participants, had fewer drivers and might offer competitive costs.

5. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - Given the balanced usage on both routes and the previous cost-effectiveness of O-R-D, participants might not dramatically change their choices.
   - However, expecting an adjustment due to payoff optimization, some participants might shift slightly, possibly increasing O-L-D traffic.

Considering the above analysis, sticking with **O-R-D** could still be a wise choice. This decision leverages the balanced congestion from last round, aiming to maintain or improve cost-effectiveness if congestion patterns hold or shift slightly but not drastically.

2. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-R-D:**
   - The travel cost formula for route O-R-D is 210 + 10Y = 260.
   - Solving for Y gives: 10Y + 210 = 260 → 10Y = 50 → Y = 5.
   - Therefore, 5 participants, including yourself, chose route O-R-D last round.

3. **Determine Number of Drivers on Route O-L-D:**
   - With 18 total participants, this means 18 - 5 = 13 participants chose O-L-D.

4. **Analysis:**
   - O-R-D had a relatively low congestion with only 5 drivers, resulting in a low travel cost and a high payoff.
   - The O-L-D route had heavier congestion with 13 drivers, likely leading to higher costs for those choosing it.

5. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - Given the favorable conditions and relatively low congestion on O-R-D, some participants from the congested O-L-D might consider switching to O-R-D to reduce costs.
   - If too many shift, O-R-D could become more congested, but there's room for strategic balancing that takes advantage of the current low usage.

Given these insights, considering the strong payoff from the previous round, staying on **O-R-D** is likely beneficial. This decision anticipates that while some may switch, the congestion difference may still maintain an advantage in costs for you.
