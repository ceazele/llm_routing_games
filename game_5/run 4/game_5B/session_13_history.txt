System Message: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make an informed decision about which route to choose, let's analyze the costs:

1. **Route O-L-D:**
   - Cost = 10X + 210
   - X is the number of participants choosing this route. This means the cost is dependent on how many people select this route. If fewer people choose this, the cost will be lower.

2. **Route O-R-D:**
   - Cost = 210 + 10Y
   - Y represents the number of participants choosing this route. Since it starts with a high fixed cost, it's optimal when fewer participants choose it, to keep the additional cost low.

Given the structure of the costs:
- Route O-L-D has a variable cost initially but then a fixed component, so it's advantageous when fewer participants choose it.
- Route O-R-D has a high fixed starting cost but can be advantageously low if very few choose this route since the additional cost won't have as much impact.

**Strategic Decision:**
- The goal is to minimize the travel cost. Since there are 18 participants, the overall pattern and previous rounds' trends (if known) should dictate the choice.
- In initial rounds, choosing O-R-D could be beneficial if you anticipate that most people will choose O-L-D to start with, trying to initially evade high costs.

**Decision Making:**
- Without insights into what others are likely to choose in this particular round (in absence of previous trends or announcements), a balanced initial choice would be to start with O-R-D because it ensures that if others primarily target what seems cheaper initially (O-L-D), I won't immediately face congestion.
- As the rounds progress, adjust based on observed behavior - if players heavily favor O-R-D later (as it's less burdened by costs when fewer choose it), switch strategies.

**Conclusion:**
If choosing without previous round data or assuming this is the first round, consider initially selecting the route that might be less obvious to the majority, as this might provide a strategic advantage.

Considering these factors, my choice is: `O-R-D`.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Your Payoff: 100


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the information from the previous round, let's reassess the situation more strategically:

1. **Previous Round Overview:**
   - You chose O-R-D and ended with a payoff of 100.
   - This implies your total cost was 300 (since your endowment is 400 and you had a payoff of 100). 
   - Based on the cost formula for O-R-D, which is 210 + 10Y, we determine:
     \( 210 + 10Y = 300 \)
     Solving for Y gives:
     \( 10Y = 90 \)
     \( Y = 9 \)
   - This means 9 participants, including yourself, chose route O-R-D.

2. **Insights:**
   - Half the participants (roughly) chose O-R-D last round, leading to a relatively high variable cost of 90 from the crowding effect.
   - The remainder of the participants (9) must have chosen O-L-D.

3. **Cost Analysis for O-L-D:**
   - For O-L-D, the cost = 10X + 210.
   - With 9 participants choosing O-L-D, the cost for them would be:
     \( 10 \times 9 + 210 = 300 \)
   - This suggests choosing O-L-D resulted in the same cost as O-R-D in the last round.

4. **Strategic Decision for Next Round:**
   - The costs were equal for both routes last round due to symmetry in participant distribution. 
   - To gain a payoff advantage, we need to select the route fewer participants might choose this round. 
   - If others follow a similar distribution pattern, slight deviations or trends need observing.
   - As half the participants chose O-R-D last round, they might expect others to diverge from a 50/50 split. A strategic choice is to pick the opposite route participants expect the majority to not choose.

**Conclusion:**
- We might anticipate that some drivers will switch to O-L-D thinking it might be less crowded.
- To counter this and potentially benefit from fewer people on O-R-D, let's choose O-R-D again if participants from O-L-D might switch in hope of lowering costs.

Therefore, my route choice for this round is: `O-R-D`.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 13.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Your Payoff: 100


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the repeated pattern and results from the previous round, let's analyze our decision further:

1. **Previous Round Specifics:**
   - You chose O-R-D and ended with a payoff of 100, meaning the total cost incurred was 300.
   - This reflects that the number of participants (Y) choosing this route was such that 210 + 10Y = 300.
   - Solve for Y: 
     \[ 
     10Y = 90 \implies Y = 9 
     \]
   - This indicates 9 participants chose O-R-D, while the other 9 chose O-L-D.

2. **Revisiting the Cost Structure for O-L-D:**
   - Cost for O-L-D: 10X + 210.
   - With 9 participants choosing O-L-D, the cost for them was:
     \[
     10 \times 9 + 210 = 300
     \]
   - This means the two routes were balanced in terms of costs last round.

3. **Strategic Consideration:**
   - Given that both routes ended up costing 300, players are incentivized to switch to achieve a better payoff.
   - If players expect O-R-D to be chosen by many again, they might opt for O-L-D hoping for less congestion.

4. **Optimal Decision for This Round:**
   - To maximize payoff, it's crucial to choose the route less expected by the majority in the hope of minimizing the cost due to fewer drivers.
   - Given previous balanced participation, a shift to O-L-D by players from O-R-D could be anticipated.

- **Intuition:**
  - If most drivers anticipate a switch to O-L-D, sticking with O-R-D might yield a lower cost.
  - Switching to O-L-D could potentially result in a lower cost if the majority does shift to O-R-D instead.

**Decision Making:**
Considering possible tendencies for players to opt for a switch and sharing this analysis, let's choose O-L-D this round based on a potential pattern shift.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 13.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Your Payoff: 100


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Based on the continuous results and understanding the situation, let's break down the decision-making process:

1. **Previous Round Information:**
   - You chose O-L-D and received a payoff of 100. This implies your total cost was 300.
   - For O-L-D, the cost is calculated as 10X + 210.
   - Setting the equation: 
     \[
     10X + 210 = 300
     \]
     Solving for X gives:
     \[
     10X = 90 \implies X = 9
     \]
   - Therefore, 9 participants chose O-L-D and 9 participated in O-R-D, maintaining an equal split.

2. **Cost Analysis and Player Behavior:**
   - Both routes still resulted in the same cost for each participant.
   - Participants might now consider changing strategy given no net benefit was gained from their choice.
   - Expecting a balanced flow might lead participants to try switching routes to minimize personal costs.

3. **Possible Switches:**
   - If a decent number of participants consider the costs and attempt to switch, there could be shifts in cost distribution this round.
   - If the switch happens from O-L-D to O-R-D, then O-L-D might be advantageous with fewer people.

4. **Strategy for This Round:**
   - Anticipating player switching to try and reduce congestion-induced extra costs, sticking with O-L-D could be beneficial if some from O-L-D shift to O-R-D.
   - Conversely, if players think along these lines and similarly choose to stay or switch collectively, O-R-D could also be the winner.

**Optimal Choice:**
Given the tendency for participants to try minimizing costs by switching and the 50/50 split outcome for several rounds, staying with O-L-D might lead to fewer participants and thus lower costs.

My decision for this round is to choose the route: `O-L-D`.

```json

```

Human: You are agent 13.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Your Payoff: 100


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: With the ongoing pattern, let's take a deeper look into making a strategic decision:

1. **Summary of Insights from Previous Rounds:**
   - You consistently selected O-L-D and received a payoff of 100, indicating that the total cost remained at 300.
   - This suggests that the number of participants choosing O-L-D and O-R-D continued to split at 9 each.
   - This equal split has caused costs to stabilize around the same value for both routes.

2. **Analyzing the Situation:**
   - Both routes currently offer identical costs because of the balanced participation.
   - The lack of change in strategy (from consistently obtaining the same outcome) might prompt participants to reassess and switch their choices.
   - Switching behaviors could shake up the equilibrium.

3. **Participant Behavior Expectation:**
   - Other participants may also be ready to make changes to see if they can capture a higher payoff.
   - If many players switch from O-L-D to O-R-D or vice versa, the resulting participant distribution might lower the cost for the less chosen route.

4. **Strategic Adjustment:**
   - The aim is to anticipate which route will have fewer participants this round.
   - Predicting that some participants will switch to O-R-D, it might be beneficial to remain on O-L-D if fewer participants switch to it.

**Decision for This Round:**
- To potentially exploit changes in participant strategy, maintain the choice of O-L-D in anticipation that enough participants will switch to the alternate route, therefore reducing congestion.

Based on this analysis, my choice is to stick with the route: `O-L-D`.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 13.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Your Payoff: 130


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: The recent change in payoff indicates a shift in the number of participants choosing each route. Let's break down the information:

1. **Previous Round Summary:**
   - You chose O-L-D and received a payoff of 130. This means your travel cost was 270 (from the 400 point endowment).
   - If the cost for O-L-D is 10X + 210, setting:
     \[
     10X + 210 = 270
     \]
     Solving for X:
     \[
     10X = 60 \implies X = 6
     \]
   - This indicates only 6 participants, including yourself, chose O-L-D in the previous round.

2. **Insight Gained:**
   - This suggests that 12 participants chose O-R-D (more than in previous rounds), increasing the costs for the O-R-D route.
   - Since your payoff increased, it was advantageous to choose O-L-D last round.

3. **Strategic Consideration for Next Round:**
   - If participants who experienced higher costs on O-R-D last round decide to switch to O-L-D, the cost structure for O-L-D could increase again.
   - Conversely, those on O-R-D who had higher costs due to a larger participant count might react by switching routes.

4. **Decision Strategy:**
   - Anticipating further switches, a key strategic choice is to infer where the majority might shift and potentially do the opposite to benefit from a lower participant count on my chosen route.
   - It's beneficial to continue on O-L-D if you suspect others might switch back to O-R-D after experiencing high costs.

**Decision for This Round:**
To preemptively react to trends while considering the payoff benefit from being one of the few on O-L-D, I will choose the route: `O-L-D`.

Human: You are agent 13.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Your Payoff: 10


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: The significant drop in payoff to 10 indicates a major shift in the number of participants choosing the routes. Let's analyze the scenario to make an informed decision:

1. **Previous Round Analysis:**
   - You chose O-L-D and received a payoff of 10, which means your travel cost was 390 (from the 400 endowment).
   - Using the formula for O-L-D: 10X + 210, we find:
     \[
     10X + 210 = 390
     \]
     Solving for X:
     \[
     10X = 180 \implies X = 18
     \]
   - This indicates all 18 participants, including yourself, chose O-L-D.

2. **Observations:**
   - With all participants having chosen O-L-D, the congestion drastically increased the costs.
   - This implies no participants chose O-R-D in the previous round, meaning O-R-D's cost would have been fixed at 210.

3. **Strategic Adjustments Needed:**
   - Given that all participants picked O-L-D, it is reasonable to expect that many will switch to O-R-D in the upcoming round to escape the increased costs.
   - As a result, choosing O-R-D might likely yield a lower cost this round.

4. **Decision Strategy:**
   - To gain an advantage, focus on the route that is most likely to have fewer participants due to previous high costs.
   - Since no one chose O-R-D last round, switching to O-R-D is reasonable given the expectation of many switching away from O-L-D.

**Decision for This Round:**
Given the likelihood of others switching to O-R-D to minimize costs, choosing O-R-D should offer a competitive advantage.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Your Payoff: 10


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: The payoff of 10 once again suggests a major congestion issue, similar to previous rounds. Let's carefully analyze the situation and devise a plan for the next decision:

1. **Previous Round Details:**
   - You chose O-R-D and received a payoff of 10, indicating a travel cost of 390.
   - The cost formula for O-R-D is 210 + 10Y. Setting the equation:
     \[
     210 + 10Y = 390
     \]
     Solving for Y:
     \[
     10Y = 180 \implies Y = 18
     \]
   - This tells us that all 18 participants chose O-R-D.

2. **Observations:**
   - This full convergence on O-R-D mirrors earlier patterns when all participants crowded on one route, driving up costs significantly.
   - Given that everyone took O-R-D, this left the O-L-D route completely vacant.

3. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - Participants will likely seek to avoid the congestion and high costs faced at O-R-D and switch back to O-L-D.
   - A large shift is anticipated based on historical oscillation when one route becomes overly costly.

4. **Decision-Making Strategy:**
   - Participants looking to lower their travel costs will likely shift due to the high payoffs from sparingly populated routes.
   - Opting for the less congested route is important, which given the shift in the last two turns, hints that many will move back to O-L-D.

**Decision for This Round:**
To potentially gain an advantage due to expected shifts, select the route that was less used last round. Therefore, choose: `O-L-D`.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 13.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Your Payoff: 20


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: The information from the previous round indicates a slightly less severe congestion problem for route O-L-D compared to prior outcomes. Let's analyze what happened and make a strategic decision:

1. **Previous Round Analysis:**
   - You chose O-L-D and received a payoff of 20, implying your travel cost was 380.
   - Using the cost formula for O-L-D: 10X + 210, we set up:
     \[
     10X + 210 = 380
     \]
     Solving for X:
     \[
     10X = 170 \implies X = 17
     \]
   - This means 17 participants, including you, chose O-L-D, leaving only 1 participant on O-R-D.

2. **Observations and Trends:**
   - The cost for O-R-D would have remained 210 as it was not substantially chosen.
   - A minor shift occurred, but a large majority stuck to O-L-D, indicating a high cost due to congestion.

3. **Strategic Implications:**
   - The majority sticking to O-L-D suggests dissatisfaction with O-R-D in the prior round, but not enough participants shifted.
   - Now that the pattern reveals high congestion on O-L-D, future behavior might derive towards balancing the route selection more evenly.

4. **Next Round Strategy:**
   - Many participants may now perceive O-R-D as the more logical next choice, knowing approximately 17 congested O-L-D the prior round.
   - Expect a significant shift towards O-R-D to escape the high cost on O-L-D.

**Decision for This Round:**
Given the high cost on O-L-D due to congestion and likely behavioral correction by participants, choose the route that was less congested:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Your Payoff: 20


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's analyze the situation from the last round where the payoff was 20. This indicates a similar pattern of congestion as previously seen. Here's a step-by-step evaluation:

1. **Previous Round Summary:**
   - You chose O-R-D and received a payoff of 20, meaning your travel cost was 380.
   - Using the cost formula for O-R-D: 210 + 10Y, we have:
     \[
     210 + 10Y = 380
     \]
     Solving for Y:
     \[
     10Y = 170 \implies Y = 17
     \]
   - This indicates that 17 participants, including you, chose O-R-D.

2. **Observations:**
   - This reflects a high level of congestion on the O-R-D route last round.
   - Only 1 participant opted for O-L-D, so the cost there would have been attractive at 220 (10X + 210 for X = 1).

3. **Current Strategic Consideration:**
   - The congestion on O-R-D suggests a strong tendency to switch back to a less congested option.
   - As the majority experienced high costs, they might move to O-L-D.

4. **Consider the Behavior Patterns:**
   - Given the historical pattern of oscillating majorities, many participants are likely to switch, seeking a cost advantage.
   - Anticipate significant movement toward the less-chosen route from last round.

**Decision for This Round:**
To leverage participant movement for minimized costs, choose the route that was less occupied in the previous round. Therefore, select: `O-L-D`.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Your Payoff: 30


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: The payoff of 30 from the previous round indicates that congestion on O-L-D has decreased somewhat compared to earlier, but it's still significant. Let's break down what occurred and plan our next move:

1. **Previous Round Analysis:**
   - You chose O-L-D and received a payoff of 30, resulting in a travel cost of 370.
   - Using the cost formula for O-L-D: 10X + 210, we set up:
     \[
     10X + 210 = 370
     \]
     Solving for X:
     \[
     10X = 160 \implies X = 16
     \]
   - This means 16 participants, including yourself, chose O-L-D.

2. **Current State Analysis:**
   - With 16 participants on O-L-D, it was less populated than previously, but still congested.
   - The remaining 2 participants chose O-R-D, with their cost being 230, yielding a payoff of 170 for them.

3. **Strategic Shift:**
   - The significant number still choosing O-L-D indicates some participants seeking lower congestion.
   - Those facing high costs on O-L-D may now consider switching to O-R-D, perceiving it as a less congested route.

4. **Player Behavior Expectation:**
   - Given the large number on O-L-D, many players may switch to O-R-D to avoid congestion.
   - Choosing the less congested route strategically offers a more favorable outcome.

**Decision for This Round:**
Given the anticipation that many participants may pivot to O-R-D to avoid high costs on O-L-D, choose the route that was less occupied previously:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 13.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Your Payoff: 20


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: In the last round, a payoff of 20 suggests significant congestion on the O-R-D route. Let's analyze the situation step-by-step to decide for the next round:

1. **Previous Round Summary:**
   - You chose O-R-D and received a payoff of 20, which means your travel cost was 380 (from the 400 point endowment).
   - The cost formula for O-R-D is 210 + 10Y. Setting the equation:
     \[
     210 + 10Y = 380
     \]
     Solving for Y:
     \[
     10Y = 170 \implies Y = 17
     \]
   - Thus, 17 participants chose O-R-D.

2. **Observations:**
   - Almost all players chose O-R-D, leading to severe congestion.
   - Only 1 player selected O-L-D, experiencing a very low cost (220).

3. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - Given the high congestion experienced on O-R-D, participants will likely aim to reduce their costs by switching to O-L-D.
   - A substantial number will likely move to O-L-D which they perceive as less congested.

4. **Decision Strategy:**
   - To avoid congestion and maximize payoff, choose the route that was underutilized the previous turn as participants seek lower costs.
   - The switch to O-L-D is logical given its prior minimal usage.

**Decision for This Round:**
Considering behavior patterns and congestion, choose the route that was less congested in the previous round. Therefore, select: `O-L-D`.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 13.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Your Payoff: 20


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the payoff of 20 from the last round for choosing O-L-D, the route was clearly congested. Let's work through the scenario step-by-step to determine how to proceed:

1. **Previous Round Details:**
   - You chose O-L-D and received a payoff of 20, meaning your travel cost was 380.
   - Using the cost formula for O-L-D: 10X + 210, we have:
     \[
     10X + 210 = 380
     \]
     Solving for X:
     \[
     10X = 170 \implies X = 17
     \]
   - This indicates 17 participants chose O-L-D.

2. **Observations:**
   - Nearly everyone chose O-L-D, leading to high congestion costs.
   - Only 1 participant went for O-R-D, enjoying significantly lower costs (220).

3. **Strategic Consideration:**
   - Many participants will likely react to the high congestion experienced on O-L-D by switching to O-R-D.
   - A shift in participant distribution is expected as players attempt to minimize their costs.

4. **Decision Strategy:**
   - The opportunity is in selecting the less congested route; given the near-total switch to O-L-D, expect a substantial shift back to O-R-D.
   - Anticipate lower costs on O-R-D as participants attempt to spread out and avoid congestion.

**Decision for This Round:**
To exploit the expected switch and minimize costs, choose the route that was less congested last round: `O-R-D`.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 13.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Your Payoff: 20


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: With a payoff of 20 from the previous round for choosing O-R-D, it's evident that congestion occurred on this route. Here's the analysis and plan:

1. **Previous Round Details:**
   - You chose O-R-D and received a payoff of 20, meaning your travel cost was 380.
   - The cost formula for O-R-D is: 210 + 10Y. Thus:
     \[
     210 + 10Y = 380
     \]
     Solving for Y:
     \[
     10Y = 170 \implies Y = 17
     \]
   - This indicates 17 participants chose O-R-D, while only 1 participant chose O-L-D.

2. **Observations:**
   - O-R-D experienced heavy congestion due to a large number of participants.
   - Only one participant on O-L-D benefitted from significantly lower costs at 220.

3. **Strategic Consideration:**
   - Observing the trend, many will likely switch to O-L-D in an attempt to escape the congestion experienced on O-R-D.
   - Players look to balance the route usage to minimize their costs based on observed congestion trends.

4. **Decision Strategy:**
   - The best strategy involves selecting the less crowded route, which is expected to be O-L-D after all but one chose O-R-D.
   - Anticipate many participants will make the strategic choice to switch to O-L-D to avoid high costs.

**Decision for This Round:**
To take advantage of potential shifts and reduce costs, choose the route that was less congested in the previous round: `O-L-D`.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 13.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Your Payoff: 30


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the payoff of 30 from the previous round for choosing O-L-D, this indicates a reduction in congestion compared to prior rounds, though still substantial. Let's analyze the current situation and plan accordingly:

1. **Previous Round Analysis:**
   - You chose O-L-D and received a payoff of 30, indicating a travel cost of 370.
   - Using the cost formula for O-L-D: 10X + 210, we set up:
     \[
     10X + 210 = 370
     \]
     Solving for X:
     \[
     10X = 160 \implies X = 16
     \]
   - This means 16 participants chose O-L-D.

2. **Current Situation:**
   - With 16 participants on O-L-D, there was significant congestion.
   - This indicates that 2 participants opted for O-R-D, which cost them 230 (a payoff of 170).

3. **Strategic Evaluation:**
   - The slight change in distribution suggests that more participants saw benefit in switching back to O-L-D.
   - Given this, those who faced higher costs might switch back to O-R-D, making it potentially more favorable this round.

4. **Decision-Making Strategy:**
   - Anticipating shifts, especially if others plan to move to the previously less crowded option, switching to O-R-D could be advantageous.
   - If participants react to the high O-L-D turnout by moving to O-R-D, costs could decrease there.

**Decision for This Round:**
To preemptively benefit from expected participant shifts, choose the route that fewer people might select based on the last round's costs. Therefore, opt for: `O-R-D`.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 13.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Your Payoff: 90


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: The improved payoff of 90 from choosing O-R-D in the last round indicates a significantly reduced congestion on this route. This suggests a strategic opportunity based on participant distribution. Here’s how to analyze the situation and decide on the next move:

1. **Previous Round Analysis:**
   - You chose O-R-D and received a payoff of 90, meaning your travel cost was 310.
   - The cost formula for O-R-D is 210 + 10Y. Thus:
     \[
     210 + 10Y = 310
     \]
     Solving for Y:
     \[
     10Y = 100 \implies Y = 10
     \]
   - This indicates 10 participants chose O-R-D.

2. **Observations:**
   - With 10 participants choosing O-R-D, it was less congested compared to previous scenarios.
   - This suggests 8 participants chose O-L-D, experiencing costs of 290 (a payoff of 110).

3. **Strategic Consideration:**
   - The relatively balanced distribution between routes led to lower costs on both routes compared to when one route was heavily favored.
   - Participants from O-L-D might consider switching to O-R-D, expecting it to remain advantageous.

4. **Player Behavior Expectation:**
   - Given the dispersion of participants last round, the choice for the upcoming round should consider potential shifts in participants aiming to optimize their route choice.
   - Both routes seemed to balance out costs, but the key is optimizing in anticipation of shifts.

**Decision for This Round:**
To leverage the current balance and maximize payoff, maintain participation in the less congested route from the previous round if anticipating no drastic shifts. Thus, choose: `O-R-D`.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 13.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Your Payoff: 120


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: The significant increase in payoff to 120 from choosing O-R-D shows that congestion on this route was minimal. This is indicative of a strategic opportunity based on participant distribution from the last round. Here's the detailed analysis and decision-making process:

1. **Last Round Analysis:**
   - You opted for O-R-D and received a payoff of 120, implying your travel cost was 280.
   - The cost formula for O-R-D is 210 + 10Y. Therefore:
     \[
     210 + 10Y = 280
     \]
     Solving for Y:
     \[
     10Y = 70 \implies Y = 7
     \]
   - This means 7 participants chose O-R-D.

2. **Observations:**
   - With 7 participants on O-R-D, the route was less congested than before.
   - This implies 11 participants selected O-L-D, which resulted in a higher cost of 320 (payoff of 80).

3. **Strategic Consideration:**
   - The reduced number on O-R-D led to a much better payoff, incentivizing repeats or switches depending on observed patterns.
   - Participants on O-L-D may now consider switching to O-R-D, expecting lower congestion and costs.

4. **Player Behavior Expectation:**
   - Given higher costs on O-L-D, it's likely that some may switch to O-R-D to benefit from previously observed low congestion.
   - Consider the potential for a balanced distribution between routes, avoiding extreme choices likely to lead to congestion.

**Decision for This Round:**
Given the strategic advantage previously observed with lower congestion on O-R-D, and anticipating shifts from participants trying to minimize costs, maintain route selection to potentially continue yielding satisfactory payoffs. Therefore, choose: `O-R-D`.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 13.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Your Payoff: 50


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: A payoff of 50 from choosing O-R-D in the last round indicates more congestion on this route compared to the round before. Let's analyze the details to make a well-informed decision for the next round:

1. **Previous Round Analysis:**
   - You chose O-R-D and received a payoff of 50, which means your travel cost was 350.
   - Using the cost formula for O-R-D: 210 + 10Y, we have:
     \[
     210 + 10Y = 350
     \]
     Solving for Y:
     \[
     10Y = 140 \implies Y = 14
     \]
   - This indicates that 14 participants chose O-R-D.

2. **Observations:**
   - With 14 participants on O-R-D, congestion increased, leading to a higher cost per participant.
   - This implies only 4 participants chose O-L-D, resulting in a lower cost of 250 (payoff of 150) for those participants.

3. **Strategic Consideration:**
   - The high number of participants on O-R-D suggests many will consider switching to O-L-D to escape increased congestion.
   - Anticipating the general behavior pattern, participants may try to balance or even skew toward the less congested route from last round.

4. **Player Behavior Expectation:**
   - Given the observable switch tendency, many may choose O-L-D to seek lower costs.
   - It's important to anticipate over-corrections and exploit opportunities where congestion might appear lesser.

**Decision for This Round:**
To effectively handle potential shifts and manage congestion costs, choose the less congested route from the previous round or anticipate participant skew. Therefore, choose: `O-L-D`.

Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: The payoff of 40 from choosing O-L-D indicates a moderate level of congestion on this route in the last round. Let's analyze the situation thoroughly to decide on the next move:

1. **Previous Round Analysis:**
   - You chose O-L-D and received a payoff of 40, meaning your travel cost was 360.
   - The cost formula for O-L-D is 10X + 210. Hence:
     \[
     10X + 210 = 360
     \]
     Solving for X:
     \[
     10X = 150 \implies X = 15
     \]
   - This indicates 15 participants selected O-L-D.

2. **Current State Overview:**
   - With 15 participants on O-L-D, the route was fairly congested.
   - This suggests that 3 participants opted for O-R-D, which would give them a cost of 240 (payoff of 160).

3. **Strategic Implications:**
   - The high number of participants choosing O-L-D could lead many to attempt a switch to O-R-D, seeking less congestion and reduced costs.
   - Anticipate that those facing high costs on O-L-D will likely adjust their strategy.

4. **Player Behavior Anticipation:**
   - With the majority experiencing higher costs on O-L-D, expect a shift in participants toward O-R-D.
   - Keeping the trend in mind, selecting a route that was less popular might yield lower costs in the next round.

**Decision for This Round:**
To minimize costs and capitalize on expected shifts, opt for the route that experienced fewer participants in the last round. Thus, select: `O-R-D`.

   - You chose O-R-D and received a payoff of 30, meaning your travel cost was 370.
   - The cost formula for O-R-D is 210 + 10Y. We set up:
     \[
     210 + 10Y = 370
     \]
     Solving for Y:
     \[
     10Y = 160 \implies Y = 16
     \]
   - This indicates 16 participants chose O-R-D.

2. **Observations:**
   - Heavy congestion on O-R-D resulted from 16 participants choosing it.
   - Consequently, only 2 participants chose O-L-D, resulting in a cost of 230 (with a payoff of 170).

3. **Strategic Implications:**
   - With significant congestion experienced on O-R-D, participants may anticipate lower costs by switching to O-L-D.
   - Historically, players act to avoid congestion by shifting routes, based on previous experiences.

4. **Player Behavior Anticipation:**
   - With many facing high costs on O-R-D, a shift towards O-L-D is likely as players aim to minimize their travel costs.
   - Your decision should aim to predict and capitalize on this shift.

**Decision for This Round:**
To optimize for fewer participants and reduced costs due to expected participant shifts, opt for the route that was less congested last round. Therefore, choose: `O-L-D`.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Your Payoff: 30


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given your payoff of 30 from choosing O-L-D in the last round, this indicates significant congestion on this route. Let’s analyze the situation thoroughly to decide on the best strategy for the next round:

1. **Previous Round Analysis:**
   - You chose O-L-D and received a payoff of 30, meaning your travel cost was 370.
   - The cost formula for O-L-D is 10X + 210. This setup gives us:
     \[
     10X + 210 = 370
     \]
     Solving for X:
     \[
     10X = 160 \implies X = 16
     \]
   - This indicates 16 participants selected O-L-D.

2. **Observations:**
   - O-L-D had 16 participants, resulting in high congestion and travel costs.
   - Only 2 participants chose O-R-D, with much lower costs of 230, thus obtaining a high payoff of 170.

3. **Strategic Implications:**
   - Heavy congestion suggests that many participants might consider switching to O-R-D for potentially lower costs.
   - Participants frequently shift away from high-cost routes to seek out those with expected lower congestion.

4. **Player Behavior Anticipation:**
   - With many experiencing high costs on O-L-D, anticipate a shift towards O-R-D in pursuit of reduced costs.
   - Predicting and joining the likely fewer participants can result in a better payoff.

**Decision for This Round:**
Given the potential for significant movement to O-R-D, opt for the route that faced less congestion previously. Therefore, choose: `O-R-D`.

     210 + 10Y = 370
     \]
     Solving for Y:
     \[
     10Y = 160 \implies Y = 16
     \]
   - This indicates that 16 participants chose O-R-D.

2. **Observations:**
   - The route O-R-D experienced significant congestion with 16 participants, leading to increased costs.
   - This means only 2 participants chose O-L-D, experiencing a lower cost of 230, which would have provided a payoff of 170.

3. **Strategic Implications:**
   - Given the heavy congestion on O-R-D, many participants may now consider switching to O-L-D in hopes of benefiting from lower congestion and costs.
   - Historically, players adjust their route choice in response to experiencing high congestion costs.

4. **Player Behavior Anticipation:**
   - With many anticipating lower costs on O-L-D, a shift is likely as players aim to escape congestion on O-R-D.
   - Making the decision to switch to O-L-D could potentially maximize the payoff by joining fewer participants.

LLM Output: With a payoff of 40 from choosing O-L-D in the previous round, the congestion was moderate. Let's break down the information and decide the best course of action for this round:

1. **Previous Round Analysis:**
   - You chose O-L-D and received a payoff of 40, indicating your travel cost was 360.
   - The cost formula for O-L-D is 10X + 210. We set up:
     \[
     10X + 210 = 360
     \]
     Solving for X:
     \[
     10X = 150 \implies X = 15
     \]
   - This means 15 participants chose O-L-D.

2. **Observations:**
   - With 15 participants on O-L-D, the route had moderate congestion.
   - Therefore, 3 participants chose O-R-D, leading to a cost of 240 and a payoff of 160 for them.

3. **Strategic Implications:**
   - The relatively high number of participants on O-L-D suggests that some may consider switching to O-R-D to reduce their costs.
   - Participants frequently shift routes to avoid repeating high congestion costs.

4. **Player Behavior Anticipation:**
   - Many on O-L-D might anticipate a reduction in congestion on O-R-D and could switch routes based on their expectations of last round's dynamics.
   - Selecting the less congested route from the previous round can often lead to a more favorable payoff scenario.

System Message: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment L-R, cost function: 0
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 3 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 3 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-L-R-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
Supposing that you choose route O-L-R-D, 3 other drivers choose route O-L-D, and 14 additional drivers choose route O-R-D.
Then, your total travel cost for that period is equal to (10 x 4) + 0 + (10 x 14) = 180.
Note that in this example, 4 drivers (including you) traveled on the segment O-L and 14 drivers (again, including you) traveled the segment R-D to go from O to D.
Each of the 3 drivers choosing route O-L-D will be charged a travel cost of (10 x 4) + 210 = 250.
Each of the 14 drivers choosing the route O-R-D will be charged a travel cost of 210 + (10 x 14) = 350.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:

     - Where X is the number of participants choosing routes O-L-D or O-L-R-D.

   - **Route O-L-R-D:**
     - Cost = 10X (for segment O-L) + 0 (for segment L-R) + 10Y (for segment R-D)
     - Where X is the number of participants choosing routes O-L-D or O-L-R-D, and Y is the number of participants choosing routes O-L-R-D or O-R-D.

   - **Route O-R-D:**
     - Cost = 210 (for segment O-R) + 10Y (for segment R-D)
     - Where Y is the number of participants choosing O-L-R-D or O-R-D.

2. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - Choose a route with potentially lower congestion to minimize costs.
   - Analyze participant behavior and likely shifts to determine the less crowded route.

3. **Potential Outcomes:**
   - If many choose O-R-D or O-L-R-D, segment R-D can become congested, making O-L-D or O-L-R-D more appealing.
   - If the majority choose O-L-D or O-L-R-D, segment O-L can become congested, making O-R-D more appealing.

4. **Decision Strategy:**
   - If there's an even distribution, consider balancing the choice where congestion is least; if this is the first round or past data suggests trends, factor this into the decision.
   - Consider a flexible strategy to adapt based on observed choices in subsequent rounds.

**Conclusion:**
Given no specific past data but expecting distribution shifts, the route choice should aim to optimize the least congested yet efficient travel cost. Given the initial scenario, trying O-L-R-D may balance between the two segments, helping analyze route behavior impacted by both segments without the fixed high cost of O-R-D.

Human: You are agent 13.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-R-D
  Your Payoff: 40


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given a payoff of 40 from choosing the route O-L-R-D in the previous round, we need to analyze what likely happened with the distribution of participants and adjust our strategy for the next round:

1. **Previous Round Summary:**
   - You chose O-L-R-D and received a payoff of 40, implying your total travel cost was 360.
   - Let's break down this result:
     - The cost components for O-L-R-D are:
       - 10X (O-L segment) + 0 (L-R) + 10Y (R-D segment) = 360
     - We know your payoff structure. Let's analyze it with possible participant configurations.

2. **Hypothetical Participant Analysis:**
   - Suppose a large number of participants chose O-L-R-D and/or O-R-D, which led to high costs, especially on R-D.
   - The main congestion costs are likely from the R-D segment since L-R is cost-free, and costs only occur on O-L if many choose O-L routes.

3. **Strategic Considerations for this Round:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** If O-L was congested but fewer people continue through L-R-D, this might lower costs.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** Previously led to high costs; reconsider if no shifts expected.
   - **Route O-R-D:** Can be expensive if there's a lot of R-D traffic, but offers a way to avoid initial O-L congestion.

4. **Speculative Predictions:**
   - If many shift routes from previous experiences, they might assume some congestion will shift but it's hard to predict without prior patterns.
   - Consider that participants might attempt to balance routes more.
   
5. **Conclusion:**
   - Adjusting based on previous costs, it might be worth seeing if another choice like O-R-D can improve payoff, especially if fewer overall choose O-R path.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Your Payoff: 30


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: With a payoff of 30 from the previous round after choosing O-R-D, it indicates significant congestion on the R-D segment. Let's analyze the scenario in depth and decide on the best strategy for the next round:

1. **Previous Round Analysis:**
   - You chose O-R-D and received a payoff of 30, implying your travel cost was 370.
   - Breakdown of costs for O-R-D:
     - Fixed cost for O-R is 210.
     - Variable cost on R-D: 10Y, where Y is the number of participants using R-D.
     - Therefore, 210 + 10Y = 370 → 10Y = 160 → Y = 16.

2. **Participant Distribution:**
   - Heavy usage of R-D given 16 participants opted for R-D segment.
   - This includes all who chose either O-R-D or O-L-R-D, indicating a preference or common choice for this path.

3. **Strategic Considerations for Next Round:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** Bypasses the R-D segment; could attract less congestion if others anticipate switching away from heavily used R-D.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** Could remain costly if R-D stays congested, but useful if few on L-R.
   - **Route O-R-D:** Remains risky unless a significant number of participants move away.

4. **Behavioral Expectations:**
   - Following a high cost on R-D, an opportunity possibly exists in O-L-D, sidestepping R-D congestion.
   - Participants could react by moving from routes involving R-D to seek lower costs.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - A shift to O-L-D might benefit given likely moves away from congested R-D, introducing potential for leveraging route underutilization.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Your Payoff: 20


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-L-R-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: With a payoff of 20 from the last round after choosing O-L-D, it indicates substantial congestion on this route as well. Let’s go through the scenario to determine the best strategic choice for the next round:

1. **Previous Round Analysis:**
   - You chose O-L-D and received a payoff of 20, meaning your travel cost was 380.
   - The total cost for O-L-D is calculated as:
     - 10X (for segment O-L) + 210 (for segment L-D) = 380
     - Thus, 10X + 210 = 380 → 10X = 170 → X = 17.

2. **Participant Distribution:**
   - The high X value indicates 17 participants traveled on the O-L segment, showing significant congestion.
   - This comprises all participants on both O-L-D and O-L-R-D, influencing O-L costs greatly.

3. **Strategic Considerations for Next Round:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** Previously congested; if others stay or move instead, could potentially be less crowded but was costly prior.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** Shares O-L segment; thus, potentially risky but bypasses L-D if R-D thereafter is lesser-used.
   - **Route O-R-D:** Though costly in past rounds due to R-D usage, not sharing O-L might mean less immediate congestion.

4. **Behavioral Expectations:**
   - Given the high cost and congestion on the O-L segment, a possible shift to O-R to bypass O-L could be expected from others.
   - Participants may react by seeking alternative routes to improve payoffs.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on these analyses, a potential strategic move might involve leveraging the expected shift away from the previously congested segment to O-R-D, hoping for balanced distribution or even underuse.

   - You chose O-R-D and received a payoff of 20, implying your travel cost was 380.
   - Cost breakdown for O-R-D:
     - Fixed cost for O-R is 210.
     - Variable cost on R-D: 10Y, where Y is the number of participants using R-D.
     - Therefore, 210 + 10Y = 380 → 10Y = 170 → Y = 17.

2. **Participant Distribution:**
   - This indicates that 17 participants used the R-D segment, showing heavy congestion.
   - This includes participants from both O-R-D and O-L-R-D.

3. **Strategic Considerations for Next Round:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** Avoids R-D congestion. If participants switch from O-R-D, this route might be less congested.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** Still involves R-D, but could potentially avoid high congestion if L-R segment dictates cost.
   - **Route O-R-D:** Currently problematic due to high R-D usage; risky unless significant cost reductions are anticipated.

4. **Behavioral Expectations:**
   - As many experienced congestion costs on R-D, anticipate potential moves away from this route to distribute congestion more evenly.
   - Some participants could find shifting to O-L-D beneficial to escape heavy R-D traffic.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on these insights, consider choosing O-L-D as shifts away from R-D could lead to O-L-D being less congested than it was or can balance participant distribution.

   - **Route O-L-R-D:** Similar performance potentially to O-R-D, as both involve R-D; maybe less risky if prediction swings back to O routes.
   - **Route O-R-D:** Enjoyed reduction, but if too many shift here due to last round's positive outcome, it might become congested again.

4. **Behavioral Expectations:**
   - The recent drop in congestion on O-R-D could lead others to switch to this route, potentially rebounding congestion.
   - Participants might react quickly to previous round outcomes, making one-shot shifts hard to predict without observable trends.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - To optimize payoff and manage congestion effectively, balance past choices with potential shifts. If a heavier reversion towards O-L routes is projected after good returns on O-R-D, maintaining a position on it might still be valuable.

LLM Output: With a payoff of 110 from choosing O-L-D in the previous round, it indicates a favorable scenario with reduced congestion on this route. Let's analyze the situation and decide on the best strategy for the next round:

1. **Previous Round Analysis:**
   - You chose O-L-D and received a payoff of 110, meaning your travel cost was 290.
   - For O-L-D, the cost is calculated as:
     - 10X (for O-L segment) + 210 (for L-D segment) = 290.
     - Solving: 10X + 210 = 290 → 10X = 80 → X = 8.

2. **Participant Distribution:**
   - X = 8 suggests that congestion on the O-L segment was low with only 8 participants.
   - These participants represent choices across O-L-D and O-L-R-D, showing a reduced presence.

3. **Strategic Considerations for Next Round:**
   - **Route O-L-D:** Recently favorable, but if others pivot to it seeing payoff, congestion might increase.
   - **Route O-L-R-D:** Shares O-L but might avoid R-D congestion if beneficial trends continue.
   - **Route O-R-D:** Could consider if a significant shift in others' preference signals overuse of O-L; less used if balance redirects.

4. **Behavioral Expectations:**
   - Given the positive outcome on O-L-D, others may switch to this route, potentially increasing congestion.
   - Reactively, others might try adjusting routes to benefit from observed congestion reductions.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - While O-L-D is attractive based on recent payoff, be mindful of shifts. If expecting a crowd on O-L, maintain balance by considering O-R-D could be beneficial if shifts seem to crowd other routes.
