System Message: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make an informed decision about which route to choose, let's analyze the given conditions and potential outcomes:

1. **Initial Setup:** 
   - We have two routes to choose from: 'O-L-D' and 'O-R-D'.
   - Each round, we are given an endowment of 400 points.

2. **Costs:**
   - Route 'O-L-D' has a cost function of 10X + 210. 
     - 10X is dependent on the number of participants who choose this route.
     - 210 is the fixed cost for segment L-D.
   - Route 'O-R-D' has a cost function of 210 + 10Y.
     - 210 is the fixed cost for segment O-R.
     - 10Y is dependent on the number of participants who choose this route.

3. **Objective:**
   - Maximize payoff by minimizing travel cost.
   - Payoff = 400 - (Travel Cost).

4. **Analysis of Travel Cost:**
   - With a total of 18 participants, the distribution of participants across the two routes will determine individual travel costs.
   - If a route is crowded (higher X or Y), the variable cost component will be higher. 

5. **Strategic Thinking:**
   - If many participants are expected to choose one route due to it being perceived as cheaper, its cost could increase significantly due to the multiplier effect (10X or 10Y).
   - Balancing where other participants might go versus where they might not go can minimize costs.
   - If you anticipate that many drivers will choose 'O-L-D', consider choosing 'O-R-D' and vice versa.

6. **Historical Patterns:**
   - If available, consider patterns from previous rounds or attempts to determine the likely distribution of participants across routes.

Without historical data to guide expectations for this specific scenario and assuming equal probability decision-making among participants, my choice would be to attempt to balance the risk and rewards, considering the impact of participant distribution.

Assuming equal distribution over time or less anticipation on each route (where participants might randomly choose without strategic grouping),

- A strategic approach would opt for a less crowded route, anticipating others might choose the lower current visible cost until their collective choice drives the potential cost higher.

Using this rationale, if one route appears consistently less chosen, choose that. Thus, suppose others in this context might favor 'O-L-D' for seemingly simpler reasons, try 'O-R-D' to minimize interaction effects initially.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 5, 'O-R-D': 13}
  Your Regret: 70


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's consider the information from the previous round and analyze the decision logically:

1. **Previous Round Summary:**
   - Your choice was 'O-R-D'.
   - Route choice distribution was 5 on 'O-L-D' and 13 on 'O-R-D'.
   - Your regret was 70 points.

2. **Analyze Your Regret:**
   - Since you experienced a regret of 70 points, it suggests that choosing the route 'O-R-D' resulted in a higher cost compared to if you had chosen 'O-L-D'.

3. **Cost Calculation from Previous Round:**
   - Your previous travel cost on 'O-R-D' = 210 + 10(13) = 210 + 130 = 340.
   - Cost if you had chosen 'O-L-D' instead = 10(6) + 210 = 60 + 210 = 270.
   - Considering the endowment of 400 points, your payoff on 'O-R-D' was 400 - 340 = 60.
   - Potential payoff on 'O-L-D' would have been 400 - 270 = 130.
   - Thus, the regret of 70 points corresponds to the difference in payoffs (130 - 60).

4. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - Seeing that 'O-R-D' was heavily chosen (13 participants) and led to increased costs due to the congestion, it seems plausible that participants may continue recognizing this pattern.
   - Based on this insight, switching to 'O-L-D' may yield a lower cost, assuming fewer participants choose it that round, or indeed they likely started shifting based on the previous revealed cost balance.

5. **Anticipate Others' Behavior:**
   - Other participants might also adjust their choices due to the high cost experienced on 'O-R-D', leading to a potential decrease in participants choosing 'O-R-D' this round.

Thus, based on this reasoning, switching to the less previously chosen route, 'O-L-D', which might now attract a balanced distribution or even fewer participants than before, stands to lower travel costs.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 1, 'O-L-D': 17}
  Your Regret: 150


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's analyze the situation from the previous round and decide our next move strategically:

1. **Previous Round Summary:**
   - Your choice was 'O-L-D'.
   - Route choice distribution was 17 on 'O-L-D' and 1 on 'O-R-D'.
   - Your regret was 150 points.

2. **Regret Interpretation:**
   - The significant regret of 150 indicates that the cost on 'O-L-D' was much higher than if you had chosen 'O-R-D'.

3. **Cost Analysis:**
   - Your travel cost on 'O-L-D' = 10(17) + 210 = 170 + 210 = 380.
   - Cost if you had chosen 'O-R-D' instead = 210 + 10(1) = 210 + 10 = 220.
   - The difference in travel costs (380 - 220 = 150) aligns with your regret, as choosing 'O-R-D' would have led to much lower costs and better payoff.

4. **Strategic Choice for Current Round:**
   - Given the previous high concentration on 'O-L-D', it is likely that some participants will switch to 'O-R-D', anticipating better costs.
   - The single participant on 'O-R-D' had minimal costs, suggesting benefits to diverging from the crowded choice.
   - To lower costs, consider switching to the previously less crowded route, 'O-R-D', anticipating a more balanced distribution.

5. **Anticipating Participant Behavior:**
   - Other participants are likely also modifying their choices, potentially causing a shift of some participants to 'O-R-D'.

With this understanding, it seems strategic to switch to 'O-R-D', where fewer participants were present previously, potentially lowering your own cost due to reduced congestion.

Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 18}
  Your Regret: 170


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's analyze the results from the previous round and strategize accordingly:

1. **Previous Round Summary:**
   - Your choice was 'O-R-D'.
   - Route choice distribution was 18 on 'O-R-D' and 0 on 'O-L-D'.
   - Your regret was 170 points.

2. **Regret and Cost Analysis:**
   - The regret of 170 points suggests that the cost on 'O-R-D' was significantly higher than it would have been on 'O-L-D'.
   - Given all 18 participants chose 'O-R-D', the cost for that route was:
     - Travel cost on 'O-R-D' = 210 + 10(18) = 210 + 180 = 390.
   - If you had chosen 'O-L-D':
     - As it was not chosen by anyone, your personal cost would have been 10(1) + 210 = 10 + 210 = 220.

3. **Strategic Choice for Current Round:**
   - 'O-L-D' was entirely unselected last round, leading to minimal costs if chosen alone or by very few participants.
   - Most participants will likely recognize the high cost of 'O-R-D' and shift to 'O-L-D' in the upcoming round.

4. **Anticipating Participant Behavior:**
   - Given that all participants experienced high costs on 'O-R-D', it's expected that there will be a shift towards 'O-L-D'.
   - However, strategic thinking suggests considering the potential overreaction; thus, opting for 'O-L-D' given its prior neglect offers lower anticipated costs if it doesn’t reach full congestion.

To reduce your cost and maximize payoff, it is advisable to choose 'O-L-D', as this offers a chance to capitalize on potentially fewer participants making the same switch, despite anticipating widespread changes.

  Your Regret: 170


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's analyze the current scenario and strategize about our next decision:

1. **Previous Round Summary:**
   - Your choice was 'O-L-D'.
   - Route choice distribution was 18 on 'O-L-D' and 0 on 'O-R-D'.
   - Your regret was 170 points.

2. **Regret and Cost Analysis:**
   - With all 18 participants choosing 'O-L-D', the cost became very high.
   - Travel cost on 'O-L-D' was: 10(18) + 210 = 180 + 210 = 390.
   - If 'O-R-D' was chosen, with 0 others, your cost would have been: 210 + 10(1) = 210 + 10 = 220.
   - This differential in cost (390 vs 220) explains your regret of 170 points.

3. **Strategic Choice for Current Round:**
   - Given all participants experienced high costs on 'O-L-D', many are likely to now switch to 'O-R-D' to avoid repetition of high costs.
   - The crowding effect on 'O-L-D' should naturally cause a dispersion towards 'O-R-D' in the next round.

4. **Anticipating Participant Behavior:**
   - It is rational to expect a noticeable shift from 'O-L-D' to 'O-R-D' by other participants seeking to minimize their own costs in reaction to communal high costs.
   - This opens an opportunity to again evaluate the least crowded path.

In response to these observations and anticipating a majority movement, it would be strategic to select 'O-R-D' for this round. This will likely offer minimized travel costs through decreased congestion, exploiting the previous reaction's underutilization.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's evaluate the scenario and make a strategic decision for the next round based on the given data:

1. **Previous Round Summary:**
   - Your choice was 'O-R-D'.
   - Route choice distribution was 18 on 'O-R-D' and 0 on 'O-L-D'.
   - Your regret was 170 points.

2. **Interpretation of Regret and Costs:**
   - Having all 18 participants choose 'O-R-D' led to high congestion, increasing costs significantly.
   - The travel cost for 'O-R-D' was: 210 + 10(18) = 210 + 180 = 390.
   - The potential cost on 'O-L-D', being unchosen, would have been the minimal fixed cost of traveling: 10(1) + 210 = 220.
   - The regret of 170 indicates that the cost of 'O-R-D' was much higher than the opportunity cost of choosing 'O-L-D'.

3. **Strategic Choice for Current Round:**
   - Considering both routes experienced high participant concentration and associated high costs in consecutive rounds, there is likely persistent oscillation as participants respond to previous outcomes trying to avoid similar results.
   - Since 'O-R-D' was overcrowded last round, it's reasonable to predict a shift of participants to 'O-L-D'.

4. **Anticipating Participant Behavior:**
   - Most participants will likely switch from 'O-R-D' back to 'O-L-D' because they seek reduced congestion costs after the high costs just incurred.
   - This opens a strategic opportunity to choose the opposite to minimize personal travel costs, benefiting from projected balanced or reduced congestion.

In response to the congestion patterns and expected behavioral shifts, to minimize travel costs, it is advisable to choose 'O-L-D', anticipating that fewer participants will remain on 'O-R-D' after consecutive rounds of crowding effects.

  Your Regret: 150


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To strategically decide on the route for the next round, we need to analyze the situation based on the latest data:

1. **Previous Round Summary:**
   - Your choice was 'O-L-D'.
   - Route choice distribution was 17 on 'O-L-D' and 1 on 'O-R-D'.
   - Your regret was 150 points.

2. **Cost and Regret Analysis:**
   - With 17 participants choosing 'O-L-D', the travel cost for that route was: 10(17) + 210 = 170 + 210 = 380.
   - If you had chosen 'O-R-D', the cost would have been: 210 + 10(1) = 210 + 10 = 220.
   - The payoff differential between your choice and the alternative (380 vs. 220) explains the regret of 150 points.

3. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - High congestion on 'O-L-D' and the associated regret suggest it's likely others will consider shifting to 'O-R-D' to avoid high costs.
   - Given only 1 participant chose 'O-R-D', it was much less congested, offering a cost advantage.

4. **Anticipating Participant Behavior:**
   - Participants who suffered high costs on 'O-L-D' will likely move to 'O-R-D' to achieve reduced costs.
   - Expecting a distribution shift towards 'O-R-D' presents an opportunity to switch strategies.

To minimize your travel cost based on potential shifts in participant choices, opting for 'O-R-D' this round would be strategic. This choice leverages anticipated reduced congestion on 'O-R-D' as others seek lower costs, effectively achieving a potential advantage relative to the last crowded choice on 'O-L-D'.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's carefully analyze the situation and make a strategic decision for the next round given the past data:

1. **Previous Round Summary:**
   - Your choice was 'O-R-D'.
   - Route choice distribution was 18 on 'O-R-D', with 0 on 'O-L-D'.
   - Your regret was 170 points.

2. **Cost and Regret Analysis:**
   - With all 18 participants choosing 'O-R-D', the travel cost was high: 210 + 10(18) = 210 + 180 = 390.
   - If you had chosen 'O-L-D', you would have incurred the base cost as no one else chose it: 10(1) + 210 = 10 + 210 = 220.
   - The significant cost difference between choosing 'O-R-D' and potentially choosing 'O-L-D' explains your regret of 170 points.

3. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - The previous complete participation on 'O-R-D' led to severe congestion and high costs, prompting others to rethink their choice.
   - Given the zero participation on 'O-L-D' in the prior round, it stands to be a less congested choice if participants disperse.

4. **Anticipating Participant Behavior:**
   - Participants are likely to shift from 'O-R-D' after experiencing high costs, seeking relief by considering 'O-L-D'.
   - This planned switch presents the risk of similar overcrowding on 'O-L-D' if not balanced, but given historical cooperation of reaching moderate peaks alternatively, an opportunity as well to fine-tune distribution.

Based on the ongoing pattern of crowd migration and attempting to leverage the balance of fewer users, opting for 'O-L-D' this round is strategically sound. This decision anticipates a continued cyclic shift in predictors' behavior, potentially achieving better individual outcomes through expected flow shifts.

  Your Regret: 150


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make a strategic decision, let’s analyze the current scenario step by step:

1. **Previous Round Summary:**
   - Your choice was 'O-L-D'.
   - Route choice distribution: 17 on 'O-L-D' and 1 on 'O-R-D'.
   - Your regret was 150 points.

2. **Cost and Regret Analysis:**
   - Cost for 'O-L-D' with 17 participants: 10(17) + 210 = 170 + 210 = 380.
   - If you had chosen 'O-R-D': 210 + 10(1) = 210 + 10 = 220.
   - The regret of 150 points reflects the lesser cost you would have incurred on 'O-R-D' (difference of 380 vs 220).

3. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - The high participant number on 'O-L-D' caused significant costs, indicating a probable shift of participants to 'O-R-D'.
   - Since 'O-R-D' was selected by only one participant, it provided a lower cost due to minimal congestion.

4. **Anticipating Participant Behavior:**
   - Following the high cost on 'O-L-D', many participants may now choose 'O-R-D' to avoid congestion they experienced.
   - This presents a shift opportunity, potentially making 'O-R-D' more crowded if participants anticipate in the same direction.

Given these observations and the cyclic nature of congestion, the strategic choice would be to switch to 'O-R-D'. This decision leverages likely reduced congestion, as many players reacting to previous high costs on 'O-L-D' might aim for 'O-R-D', partially rather than fully congesting it in cycles.

LLM Output: To make a decision for the next round, we need to carefully analyze the information from the previous round:

1. **Previous Round Summary:**
   - Your choice was 'O-R-D'.
   - Route choice distribution was 17 on 'O-R-D' and 1 on 'O-L-D'.
   - Your regret was 150 points.

2. **Cost and Regret Analysis:**
   - With 17 participants choosing 'O-R-D', the travel cost was: 210 + 10(17) = 210 + 170 = 380.
   - If you had chosen 'O-L-D', your cost would have been: 10(1) + 210 = 10 + 210 = 220.
   - This differential in cost is reflected in your regret of 150 points, highlighting that 'O-L-D' would have been a cheaper choice.

3. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - Given the high cost for those on the 'O-R-D' route, participants who experienced these costs will likely consider switching to 'O-L-D'.
   - Seeing that 'O-L-D' was chosen by only 1 participant, it suggests participants were overly concentrated on 'O-R-D', causing congestion and high costs.

4. **Anticipating Participant Behavior:**
   - Many participants will now likely shift to 'O-L-D', anticipating reduced congestion and costs compared to the previous round.

Given this setup, your goal should be to minimize costs by predicting participant behavior accurately. Since 'O-R-D' was overcrowded previously, and 'O-L-D' was underutilized, opting to switch to 'O-L-D' may provide lower costs as others might be attempting to disperse from 'O-R-D'.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make a well-informed decision for the next round, let's analyze the information provided and proceed step by step:

1. **Previous Round Summary:**
   - Your choice was 'O-L-D'.
   - Route choice distribution was 16 on 'O-L-D' and 2 on 'O-R-D'.
   - Your regret was 130 points.

2. **Cost and Regret Analysis:**
   - Travel cost on 'O-L-D' with 16 participants: 10(16) + 210 = 160 + 210 = 370.
   - On 'O-R-D', if chosen, the cost would have been: 210 + 10(2) = 210 + 20 = 230.
   - The 130 points of regret indicate that 'O-R-D' would have been a more cost-effective route by this margin.

3. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - The high number of participants on 'O-L-D' led to elevated costs due to congestion.
   - 'O-R-D' was less crowded and thus presented a lower cost last round.

4. **Anticipating Participant Behavior:**
   - Participants experiencing high costs on 'O-L-D' are likely to switch to 'O-R-D', seeking to lower costs.
   - Recognizing this pattern, there may be a noticeable shift to 'O-R-D', reducing the potential congestion on 'O-L-D'.

Given these observations and the likely behavioral shifts among participants, your strategic choice would be to select 'O-R-D'. This choice anticipates a distribution shift from others, leveraging the predicted decrease in congestion towards consistently lowering travel costs.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make an informed decision for the upcoming round, let's analyze the situation thoroughly:

1. **Previous Round Summary:**
   - Your choice was 'O-R-D'.
   - Route choice distribution was 18 on 'O-R-D' and 0 on 'O-L-D'.
   - Your regret was 170 points.

2. **Cost and Regret Analysis:**
   - The cost on 'O-R-D' with 18 participants was 210 + 10(18) = 210 + 180 = 390.
   - The potential cost on 'O-L-D', which had no participants, would have been 10(1) + 210 = 220.
   - This cost difference aligns with the regret of 170 points, suggesting 'O-L-D' would have been considerably cheaper.

3. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - The previous round's complete saturation on 'O-R-D' suggests that participants will likely switch to 'O-L-D' to escape the high costs.
   - As a result, 'O-L-D' is predicted to be less congested than 'O-R-D' in the next round due to its underutilization.

4. **Anticipating Participant Behavior:**
   - In response to the high costs incurred on 'O-R-D', many participants are expected to move to 'O-L-D' seeking better payoff by avoiding congestion.
   - This typical behavioral shift presents an opportunity to select a less congested option by opting oppositely.

Given these observations, selecting 'O-L-D' would likely result in lower travel costs, assuming participants react to the previous round's high congestion by dispersing toward what was previously unchosen.

  Your Regret: 170


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make an informed decision for the current round, let's analyze the given data and predict potential outcomes:

1. **Previous Round Summary:**
   - Your choice was 'O-L-D'.
   - Route choice distribution was 18 on 'O-L-D', and 0 on 'O-R-D'.
   - Your regret was 170 points.

2. **Cost and Regret Analysis:**
   - The travel cost for 'O-L-D' with 18 participants was 10(18) + 210 = 180 + 210 = 390.
   - If you had chosen 'O-R-D', and assuming you were alone, the cost would have been 210 + 10(1) = 210 + 10 = 220.
   - This regret of 170 points indicates that 'O-R-D' would have been significantly cheaper than 'O-L-D'.

3. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - Given the massive participation on 'O-L-D', the route became heavily congested and costly.
   - Participants who experienced the high costs on 'O-L-D' will likely consider switching to 'O-R-D' to minimize their costs.

4. **Anticipating Participant Behavior:**
   - Many participants will likely switch from 'O-L-D' to 'O-R-D', expecting lower congestion and costs.
   - This creates an opening for a lesser occupied 'O-R-D', potentially providing a lower cost route compared to a likely again congested 'O-L-D'.

Given the expectation of participant migration driven by comparative costs, the strategic decision would be to select 'O-R-D'. This takes advantage of expected decreased congestion on this route due to the recent high occupancy on 'O-L-D'.

Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make a strategic decision for the next round, let's proceed with a thorough analysis:

1. **Previous Round Summary:**
   - Your choice last round was 'O-L-D'.
   - The route choice distribution was 18 on 'O-L-D', and 0 on 'O-R-D'.
   - Your regret amounted to 170 points.

2. **Cost and Regret Analysis:**
   - Cost for 'O-L-D' with 18 participants was: 10(18) + 210 = 180 + 210 = 390.
   - If you were the only one on 'O-R-D', the cost would have been: 10(1) + 210 = 220.
   - The significant regret shows a much lower cost on 'O-R-D', indicating it would have been a better choice.

3. **Strategic Decision for Current Round:**
   - Massive overcrowding on 'O-L-D' tells us many participants will be motivated to switch to 'O-R-D' to avoid high costs.
   - 'O-R-D' went completely unused last round, indicating opportunity there for lower congestion and cost.

4. **Anticipating Participant Behavior:**
   - Given the high costs likely experienced by all on 'O-L-D', a migration of participants to 'O-R-D' can be expected.
   - Participants generally react by seeking the less congested route in future rounds.

5. **Conclusion and Decision:**
   - To potentially reduce travel costs by avoiding heavy congestion, choosing 'O-R-D' where fewer participants are expected post-adjustment should help achieve a better outcome.

With this analysis, the strategic decision is to choose 'O-R-D', anticipating it will have fewer participants moving there compared to those remaining or returning to 'O-L-D'.
