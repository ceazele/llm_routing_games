System Message: 
You will be participating in an experiment on route selection in traffic networks.
During this experiment you'll be asked to make many decisions about route selection in a traffic network game.
Your payoff will depend on the decisions you make as well as the decisions made by the other participants.

There are 18 participants in this experiment, including yourself, who will be asked to serve as drivers and choose a route to travel in a traffic network game that is described below.
You will play the game for 40 identical rounds.

Consider the very simple traffic network described below.
Nodes:
O L R D
Segments and associated costs:
Segment O-L, cost function: 10 * X
Segment O-R, cost function: 210
Segment L-D, cost function: 210
Segment R-D, cost function: 10 * X
Each driver is required to choose one of 2 routes to travel from the starting point, denoted by O, to the final destination, denoted by D.
There are 2 alternative routes and they are denoted by ['O-L-D', 'O-R-D']. 

Travel is always costly in terms of the time needed to complete a segment of the road, tolls, fuel etc.
The travel costs are written near each segment of the route you choose.
For example, if you choose route O-L-D, you will be charged a total cost of 10X + 210 where X indicates the number of participants who choose segment O-L to travel from O to L plus a fixed cost of 210 for traveling on segment L-D.
Similarly, if you choose route O-R-D, you will be charged a total travel cost of 210 + 10Y, where Y indicates the number of participants who choose the segment R-D to drive from O to D.
Please note that the cost charged for segments O-L and R-D depends on the number of drivers choosing them.
In contrast, the cost charged for traveling on segments L-D and O-R is fixed at 210 and does not depend on the number of drivers choosing them.
All the drivers make their route choices independently of one another and leave point O at the same time.

Example.
If you happen to be the only driver who chooses route O-L-D, and all other 17 drivers choose route O-R-D, then your travel cost from point O to point D is equal to (10 x 1) + 210 = 220.
If, on another round, you and 2 more drivers choose route O-R-D and 15 other drivers choose route O-L-D, then your travel cost for that round will be 210 + (10 x 3) = 240.

At the beginning of each round, you will receive an endowment of 400 points.
Your payoff for each round will be determined by subtracting your travel cost from your endowment.
Your goal is to maximize your payoff (likewise minimize your cost).
All 40 rounds have exactly the same structure.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"route": {"title": "Route", "description": "choice of route", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["route"]}
```


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make a decision on which route to choose, let's analyze the cost structure of each route and consider how other drivers' choices can affect these costs.

### Routes and Costs
1. **Route O-L-D**:
   - Cost: \(10 \times X + 210\)
   - \(X\) is the number of drivers choosing this route.

2. **Route O-R-D**:
   - Cost: \(210 + 10 \times Y\)
   - \(Y\) is the number of drivers choosing this route.

### Objective
- The endowment per round is 400 points.
- Aim to minimize travel costs to maximize the payoff.

### Initial Considerations
- **Route O-R-D** has a fixed initial cost of 210 before considering other drivers, whereas **O-L-D** starts at a cost of \(210\) plus an increasing cost as \(X\) increases.
- When everyone starts choosing **O-R-D**, the cost \(210 + 10Y\) will increase linearly.

### Strategy
- **Predictive balance**: The goal is to anticipate the distribution of drivers between routes.
- If many drivers are on route **O-L-D**, it is beneficial to choose **O-R-D** because fewer drivers will be using it, making **O-R-D** initially preferable due to its fixed cost before congestion impact.
- Conversely, if many choose **O-R-D**, **O-L-D** becomes attractive due to fewer drivers impacting the segment cost there.

### Decision
Without specific information about other drivers’ tendencies or historical data from previous rounds:
- Start with route **O-R-D** as it has a base cost of 210 which is stable until more drivers join.
- Monitor the distribution closely and adjust based on congestion observation.

Based on this strategic analysis, I'm ready to make my decision:

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 14.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 4, 'O-R-D': 14}
  Your Regret: 90


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's analyze the situation from the previous round and make a decision based on the insights gained to minimize regret and maximize payoff:

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-R-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-L-D: 4 drivers
  - O-R-D: 14 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 90

### Regret Calculation
- You chose **O-R-D**.
- Cost for O-R-D: \(210 + 10 \times 14 = 350\).
- Cost for O-L-D (if chosen): \(10 \times 4 + 210 = 250\).

Your regret of 90 points comes from choosing O-R-D instead of O-L-D, which was cheaper.

### New Considerations
- With 14 drivers heavily congesting **O-R-D**, its cost became high (350).
- **O-L-D** had fewer drivers, resulting in a lower cost (250).
  
### Strategy Adjustment
1. **Switch to O-L-D**: Based on the previous round, where fewer drivers chose O-L-D, it resulted in a lower cost.
2. Predict that O-R-D might stay popular if others don't adjust their strategy significantly.

### Decision
Given the above considerations and aiming to minimize regret, I will choose route **O-L-D** for this round.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 14.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 18}
  Your Regret: 170


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's analyze the current situation, taking lessons from previous rounds, to make an informed decision this time.

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-L-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-L-D: 18 drivers
  - O-R-D: 0 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 170

### Regret Calculation
- You chose **O-L-D**.
- Cost for O-L-D: \(10 \times 18 + 210 = 390\).
- Cost for O-R-D (if chosen): \(210 + 10 \times 0 = 210\).

Your regret of 170 was because all drivers (including you) chose O-L-D, resulting in a high cost, while O-R-D was completely empty.

### New Considerations
- Everyone crowded onto **O-L-D**, making it excessively costly.
- **O-R-D** was not utilized, thus had a minimal cost at 210.

### Strategy Adjustment
1. **Switch back to O-R-D**: Given that everyone crowded O-L-D and left O-R-D empty, switching to O-R-D could result in a significantly lower cost, assuming others might not switch immediately.
2. **Predict** that a significant number of participants might switch to O-R-D to reduce their own costs, but there might still be enough spread to make it worthwhile compared to a completely congested O-L-D.

### Decision
To minimize future regret, I will choose route **O-R-D** for this round, considering the complete congestion on O-L-D previously.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 14.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 18}
  Your Regret: 170


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's carefully consider the situation based on the outcomes from the previous rounds and craft a strategy to minimize our travel costs and hence our regret.

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-R-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-R-D: 18 drivers
  - O-L-D: 0 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 170

### Regret Calculation
- You chose **O-R-D**.
- Cost for O-R-D: \(210 + 10 \times 18 = 390\).
- Cost for O-L-D (if chosen): \(10 \times 0 + 210 = 210\).

Your regret of 170 indicates that choosing O-L-D would have been cheaper, since no one chose it last round.

### New Considerations
1. **Everyone crowded onto O-R-D**, resulting in high congestion and costs.
2. **O-L-D had no drivers**, resulting in the lowest possible cost on that route.

### Strategic Reflection
- Patterns suggest that all drivers switch simultaneously, leading to complete congestion of the previously chosen route.
- To minimize costs, we must anticipate shifts and choose the less popular route.

### Strategy Adjustment
1. **Switch to O-L-D**: Based on round patterns, since everyone crowded O-R-D, switching to O-L-D should minimize cost when assuming others continue to follow a symmetric strategy.
2. **Anticipate possible spread**: There’s a chance not everyone will switch immediately, maintaining a lower cost on O-L-D.

### Decision
To reduce future regrets, choosing route **O-L-D** is optimal, considering that O-R-D is fully congested in the last round.

{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 14.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 18}
  Your Regret: 170


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make an informed decision this round, let's analyze the situation thoroughly and plan a strategic approach based on previous outcomes:

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-L-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-L-D: 18 drivers
  - O-R-D: 0 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 170

### Regret Calculation
- You chose **O-L-D**.
- Cost for O-L-D: \(10 \times 18 + 210 = 390\).
- Cost for O-R-D (if chosen): \(210 + 10 \times 0 = 210\).

Your regret indicates that the cost could have been minimized significantly had you chosen the less crowded route.

### Observations
- Each round, all drivers chose one route completely, leaving the other route empty.
- This indicates a tendency for all participants to switch at once based on previous high-cost experiences.

### Strategic Insight
1. **Pattern Recurrence**: The likelihood that all switches occur collectively makes route congestion predictable.
2. **Opportunity in Alternation**: Alternating the choice between the routes based on previous experiences can potentially lead to lower costs.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-R-D**: Given the complete congestion of O-L-D, it's logical to assume many might switch to O-R-D, but starting from no users there allows for a potential cost advantage.
2. **Adapt and Monitor**: Be ready to switch back if the pattern continues but with anticipation for oscillation.

### Decision
Choosing route **O-R-D** should minimize costs under the assumption of collective hesitance and symmetrical shifts.

```

Human: You are agent 14.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 17, 'O-L-D': 1}
  Your Regret: 150


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the summary from the previous round, let's analyze the choices and devise a strategy to minimize travel costs and regret:

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-R-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-R-D: 17 drivers
  - O-L-D: 1 driver
- **Your Regret**: 150

### Regret Calculation
- You chose **O-R-D**.
- Cost for O-R-D: \(210 + 10 \times 17 = 380\).
- Cost for O-L-D (if chosen): \(10 \times 1 + 210 = 220\).

Your regret indicates that choosing O-L-D, which was much less crowded, would have resulted in significantly lower costs.

### Observations
- Most drivers switched to O-R-D, while only one opted for O-L-D, resulting in a much lower cost for that driver.
- This suggests a significant shift in choice patterns but indicates a stable oscillation.

### Strategic Insight
1. **Recognize the Shift**: The recent pattern where most drivers switch collectively creates an advantage for the few who choose the less crowded route.
2. **Opportunity for Cost Advantage**: It's strategic to choose the route less favored by the majority.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-L-D**: Now that O-R-D is heavily crowded, switching to O-L-D increases the likelihood of encountering fewer other drivers, reducing costs.
2. **Anticipate the Minority Choice**: Choosing the less crowded route based on the previous pattern maximizes the potential for low costs.

### Decision
To minimize costs, I will choose route **O-L-D**, anticipating that fewer drivers will switch to it immediately.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 14.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 15, 'O-R-D': 3}
  Your Regret: 110


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Based on the current situation and previous outcomes, let's evaluate the scenario step-by-step to make a well-informed decision.

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-L-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-L-D: 15 drivers
  - O-R-D: 3 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 110

### Regret Calculation
- You chose **O-L-D**.
- Cost for O-L-D: \(10 \times 15 + 210 = 360\).
- Cost for O-R-D (if chosen): \(210 + 10 \times 3 = 240\).

Your regret indicates that choosing O-R-D would have been cheaper due to less congestion.

### Observations
- A majority switched back to O-L-D, leading to higher costs due to congestion.
- Only a few drivers chose O-R-D, resulting in lower costs for them.
  
### Strategic Insight
1. **Congestion Patterns**: Historically, most drivers have heavily crowded one route based on previous high-regret experiences, inadvertently creating an economic opportunity on the less crowded route.
2. **Minority Advantage**: Being part of a smaller group of drivers on a route tends to lower costs significantly, according to the penalty function.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-R-D**: With only 3 drivers on O-R-D last round, it is less crowded and thus potentially offers lower costs.
2. **Capitalize on Overcrowding**: Expect some redistribution but maintain positioning where cost is minimized based on predicted minority travel.

### Decision
In order to minimize costs this round, I will choose route **O-R-D**, exploiting a potential cost advantage by avoiding the more crowded O-L-D.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 14.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 16, 'O-L-D': 2}
  Your Regret: 130


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Given the consistent observation of congestion patterns and outcomes, let's analyze the scenario step-by-step to optimize for the upcoming decision.

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-R-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-R-D: 16 drivers
  - O-L-D: 2 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 130

### Regret Calculation
- You chose **O-R-D**.
- Cost for O-R-D: \(210 + 10 \times 16 = 370\).
- Cost for O-L-D (if chosen): \(10 \times 2 + 210 = 230\).

The regret indicates that O-L-D, being less crowded, was significantly cheaper.

### Observations
- A large majority chose O-R-D, increasing congestion and costs.
- A minority on O-L-D benefited from much lower costs.

### Strategic Insight
1. **Reactive Shifts**: Participants are reacting to their own experiences, typically moving together as a group to the perceived better option based on the last round's results, leading to an opposite congestion cycle.
2. **Smaller Group Advantage**: The pattern of fewer participants on one route leading to lower costs is evident.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-L-D**: Given the current pattern, switching to the less crowded O-L-D, which only had 2 participants last round, is likely to provide a significant cost advantage.
2. **Predictive Shift**: Some drivers may not switch thinking others will, but staying with a less crowded assumption maximizes payoff potential.

### Decision
To minimize costs for this round, I will go with route **O-L-D**, anticipating reduced competition there.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 14.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 17, 'O-R-D': 1}
  Your Regret: 150


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make an informed decision for this round, let's carefully evaluate the recent outcomes and the recurring pattern to devise the best strategy.

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-L-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-L-D: 17 drivers
  - O-R-D: 1 driver
- **Your Regret**: 150

### Regret Calculation
- You chose **O-L-D**.
- Cost for O-L-D: \(10 \times 17 + 210 = 380\).
- Cost for O-R-D (if chosen): \(210 + 10 \times 1 = 220\).

The regret indicates that O-R-D was less crowded and significantly cheaper in this round.

### Observations
- Most drivers switched to O-L-D, while only one driver took O-R-D, significantly reducing their costs.
- This scenario shows a typical oscillation pattern with congestion shifting heavily from one route to the other.

### Strategic Insight
1. **Alternating Congestion**: Drivers are collectively oscillating between routes, reacting to previous rounds' regrets.
2. **Opportunity in Scarcity**: Consistently, the less crowded route has offered significantly lower costs.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-R-D**: Recognizing the pattern, most drivers will likely stay on or move back to O-L-D, making O-R-D less crowded.
2. **Capitalize on Being in the Minority**: Follow the pattern where the advantage has historically been with the route fewer people choose.

### Decision
To minimize costs this round, I will opt for route **O-R-D**, predicting continued congestion on O-L-D.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 14.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 17, 'O-L-D': 1}
  Your Regret: 150


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Based on the consistent oscillation in driver distribution and continued regrets, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-R-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-R-D: 17 drivers
  - O-L-D: 1 driver
- **Your Regret**: 150

### Regret Calculation
- You chose **O-R-D**.
- Cost for O-R-D: \(210 + 10 \times 17 = 380\).
- Cost for O-L-D (if chosen): \(10 \times 1 + 210 = 220\).

This regret indicates that O-L-D was far cheaper due to minimal congestion last round.

### Observations
- A large majority chose O-R-D this time, similar to previous patterns, while only one driver chose O-L-D.
- This stable oscillation continues to split driver choices drastically in favor of one route, leading to unbalanced congestion.

### Strategic Insight
1. **Predictable Pattern**: The collective shift from one heavily congested route to a previously underutilized one is clear.
2. **Seek the Unpopular Choice**: Historically, being the minority on a route has consistently provided a cost advantage.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-L-D**: Most drivers will likely attempt to avoid the high congestion they experienced on O-R-D, making O-L-D less crowded.
2. **Leverage Minority Advantage**: By opting for the route with minimal use in the previous round, cost savings are maximized.

### Decision
To optimize costs this round, I will choose route **O-L-D**, anticipating that fewer drivers will select it following the last round's high congestion on O-R-D.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 14.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
  Your Regret: 130


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's carefully consider the situation based on the results from the previous rounds and aim to minimize regret by making an informed choice for this round.

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-L-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-L-D: 16 drivers
  - O-R-D: 2 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 130

### Regret Calculation
- You chose **O-L-D**.
- Cost for O-L-D: \(10 \times 16 + 210 = 370\).
- Cost for O-R-D (if chosen): \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 230\).

Your regret shows that fewer drivers on O-R-D led to much lower costs than the heavily chosen O-L-D.

### Observations
- Most drivers continue to gravitate towards one route, leaving the other relatively open for lower costs.
- Patterns of synchrony among drivers create significant congestion on one route while the other remains a less used option.

### Strategic Insight
1. **Oscillation and Majority Choice**: The trend suggests drivers move en masse to a route that was less crowded previously, swinging congestion heavily.
2. **Optimize by Going Against the Crowd**: Being in the minority on a road has repeatedly shown a cost benefit.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-R-D**: Historically, with the majority previously focused on O-L-D, anticipate a shift away from their current choice as they try to avoid the congestion.
2. **Consistent Minority Advantage**: Aim for the less congested route by predicting shifts in mass driver decisions.

### Decision
In order to minimize costs for this round, the optimal strategy is to select route **O-R-D**, expecting fewer drivers and therefore lower costs.

  Your Regret: 110


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Based on the recurring patterns and the outcomes from the previous rounds, let's carefully evaluate the situation and decide on the best route for this round.

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-R-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-R-D: 15 drivers
  - O-L-D: 3 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 110

### Regret Calculation
- You chose **O-R-D**.
- Cost for O-R-D: \(210 + 10 \times 15 = 360\).
- Cost for O-L-D (if chosen): \(10 \times 3 + 210 = 240\).

Your regret indicates that choosing the less crowded O-L-D would have resulted in significantly lower costs.

### Observations
- A majority of drivers chose O-R-D, creating notable congestion and costs.
- A smaller number of drivers opted for O-L-D, resulting in reduced costs for those few.

### Strategic Insight
1. **Oscillating Choices**: Drivers often switch to avoid congestion, leading to alternating heavy use of routes.
2. **Minority Advantage**: Historical data consistently shows lower costs on the route fewer drivers choose.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-L-D**: With O-R-D being more crowded last round, it’s reasonable to expect that some drivers will switch to O-L-D, but likely not all.
2. **Exploit Less Congestion**: Aim to be part of the smaller group on a less congested route to gain cost efficiency.

### Decision
To minimize costs this round, I will choose route **O-L-D**, anticipating fewer drivers and maximizing cost savings.

LLM Output: Based on the predictable dynamics in previous rounds, we will make an informed decision for this round to minimize costs and regret.

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-L-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-L-D: 16 drivers
  - O-R-D: 2 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 130

### Regret Calculation
- You chose **O-L-D**.
- Cost for O-L-D: \(10 \times 16 + 210 = 370\).
- Cost for O-R-D (if chosen): \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 230\).

Your regret indicates that fewer drivers on O-R-D resulted in much lower costs.

### Observations
- The majority of drivers opted for O-L-D, resulting in congestion and higher costs, while O-R-D remained less utilized.
- This distribution reflects typical oscillations where one route becomes overcrowded while the other offers cost benefits.

### Strategic Insight
1. **Alternating Choices**: Drivers tend to switch routes collectively, creating alternating congestion patterns.
2. **Benefit of Less Crowding**: Consistently, the route with fewer drivers incurs significantly lower costs.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-R-D**: Given the heavy congestion of O-L-D last round, it's likely that many will switch to O-R-D, but starting from a low base could still offer a cost advantage.
2. **Capitalize on Transition**: Predict shifts and choose the route less likely to be heavily congested.

### Decision
In light of minimizing costs, I will choose route **O-R-D**, expecting fewer drivers for potential cost savings.

  - O-L-D: 2 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 130

### Regret Calculation
- You chose **O-R-D**.
- Cost for O-R-D: \(210 + 10 \times 16 = 370\).
- Cost for O-L-D (if chosen): \(10 \times 2 + 210 = 230\).

This indicates that O-L-D had a much lower cost due to fewer drivers choosing it.

### Observations

- A smaller number chose O-L-D, benefiting from lower costs due to less congestion.

### Strategic Insight
1. **Pattern of Congestion**: Drivers have repeatedly moved together to one route, substantially increasing costs.
2. **Advantage of Choosing the Less Crowded Route**: Historical data consistently favors the route with fewer drivers.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-L-D**: Seeing as O-R-D experienced high congestion, it is likely that others will switch to O-L-D, but not all.
2. **Leveraging Less Congestion**: Opt for the route expected to have fewer drivers to minimize travel costs.

### Decision
In order to optimize costs for this round, I will choose route **O-L-D**, anticipating reduced congestion and therefore lower costs.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 14.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
  Your Regret: 130


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's carefully re-evaluate the situation and decision-making process to determine the most cost-effective route for this round.

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-L-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-L-D: 16 drivers
  - O-R-D: 2 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 130

### Regret Calculation
- You chose **O-L-D**.
- Cost for O-L-D: \(10 \times 16 + 210 = 370\).
- Cost for O-R-D (if chosen): \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 230\).

This indicates that O-R-D had significantly lower costs because of fewer drivers selecting it.

### Observations
- A majority chose O-L-D, leading to higher congestion and increased travel costs for that route.
- A minority on O-R-D resulted in lower costs due to less congestion.

### Strategic Insight
1. **Reactionary Shifts**: Drivers tend to switch en masse to escape congestion, causing an alternating pattern between routes.
2. **Leverage Less Congestion**: The historical pattern shows a consistent advantage in choosing the less congested route.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-R-D**: Since O-L-D was significantly congested last round, expected behavior suggests a migration to O-R-D by others, but starting from fewer users last round still presents an advantage.
2. **Predicting Behavior**: Expect shifts away from a previously crowded route, aiming to maintain a position on the less congested one.

### Decision
For this round, to minimize costs, I will select route **O-R-D**, capitalizing on expected lower congestion.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 14.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 16, 'O-L-D': 2}
  Your Regret: 130


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To optimize the decision for this round, let's analyze the situation based on recurring patterns and previous outcomes:

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-R-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-R-D: 16 drivers
  - O-L-D: 2 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 130

### Regret Calculation
- Cost for O-R-D: \(210 + 10 \times 16 = 370\).
- Cost for O-L-D (if chosen): \(10 \times 2 + 210 = 230\).

Choosing O-R-D resulted in high costs because the majority of drivers were there, whereas O-L-D had minimal congestion and reduced costs.

### Observations
- High congestion on O-R-D led to higher costs last round.
- Very few drivers utilized O-L-D, keeping costs low there.

### Strategic Insight
1. **Recognize Oscillation**: Drivers seem to oscillate in large groups toward one route, seeking to avoid high congestion.
2. **Minority Advantage**: Consistently, the minority route offers lower costs due to reduced congestion.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-L-D**: Predict that, given the high congestion on O-R-D last round, some drivers will likely switch to O-L-D.
2. **Optimize Cost**: By choosing the route with previously fewer drivers, there's a strong opportunity to minimize travel costs.

### Decision
To take advantage of the less crowded option, I will select route **O-L-D** for this round, aiming for lower costs.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 14.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
  Your Regret: 130


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make a strategic decision for this round, let's reflect on the recurring patterns and optimize for the least cost outcome.

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-L-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-L-D: 16 drivers
  - O-R-D: 2 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 130

### Regret Calculation
- Cost for O-L-D: \(10 \times 16 + 210 = 370\).
- Cost for O-R-D (if chosen): \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 230\).

Choosing O-L-D resulted in high costs due to significant congestion, while O-R-D had low congestion and lower costs.

### Observations
- The majority chose O-L-D, leading to high congestion and costs.
- A minority used O-R-D, which incurred lower costs due to minimal congestion.

### Strategic Insight
1. **Predictable Switching**: Drivers may switch en masse based on previous high costs, contributing to oscillation between congested and less congested routes.
2. **Minority Advantage**: Choosing the less congested route tends to lower travel costs.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-R-D**: Given the previous high usage of O-L-D, anticipate a switch to O-R-D by others, but the starting point of fewer users last round provides an advantage.
2. **Capitalize on Predictable Shifts**: Opt for the route expected to see fewer drivers based on oscillation patterns.

### Decision
To reduce costs, I will go with route **O-R-D**, aiming to benefit from fewer drivers and lower congestion.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 14.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 16, 'O-L-D': 2}
  Your Regret: 130


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's carefully consider the decision for this round by analyzing the repetitive patterns observed and aiming to optimize for the least regret and cost.

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-R-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-R-D: 16 drivers
  - O-L-D: 2 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 130

### Regret Calculation
- Cost for O-R-D: \(210 + 10 \times 16 = 370\).
- Cost for O-L-D (if chosen): \(10 \times 2 + 210 = 230\).

The regret implies significant congestion on O-R-D, while O-L-D was less congested and thus cheaper.

### Observations
- Heavy congestion continued on O-R-D.
- Minimal congestion on O-L-D consistently resulted in lower costs.

### Analysis of Patterns
1. **Congestion Oscillation**: There is a strong feedback loop where drivers tend to migrate together, leading to alternating congestion between routes.
2. **Advantage in Minority Choice**: Historically, the less crowded route drastically reduces costs due to the linear cost increase with additional drivers.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-L-D**: Most drivers are likely to switch from the crowded O-R-D, thus making it strategic to select O-L-D based on previous swings.
2. **Anticipate the Lesser Crowded Route**: Given the decision environment, maximizing cost efficiency requires choosing the route less likely to be chosen by the majority based on the previous pattern.

### Decision
To minimize travel costs effectively this round, I will select route **O-L-D**, expecting fewer drivers and therefore reduced costs.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 14.
Summary of previous round:

  Your Regret: 130


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make a well-informed decision for this round, let’s delve into the pattern observed over the previous rounds and decide strategically:

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-L-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-L-D: 16 drivers
  - O-R-D: 2 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 130

### Regret Calculation
- Cost for O-L-D: \(10 \times 16 + 210 = 370\).
- Cost for O-R-D (if chosen): \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 230\).

The regret arises due to a higher number of drivers on O-L-D, leading to increased costs, while O-R-D had much fewer drivers and consequent lower cost.

### Observations
- The majority favored O-L-D, which led to congestion and high costs.
- The minority choice of O-R-D resulted in significantly lower travel costs due to minimal congestion.

### Analysis of Patterns
1. **Predictable Oscillation**: Drivers tend to switch together based on the previous round’s congestion, creating a predictable pattern.
2. **Minority Benefit**: The cost advantage has been consistently for those choosing the less congested option.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-R-D**: Few drivers on O-R-D suggest that others may not instantly switch, or may continue to oscillate, creating an opportunity to exploit lower congestion.
2. **Consider Minority Positioning**: Choose based on anticipated shifts, continuing the trend of opting into the road least chosen recently.

### Decision
For this round, to optimize and lower costs, the best decision is to choose route **O-R-D**, expecting potential lower driver count and associated costs.

  Your Regret: 110


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make a strategic decision in this round, we need to analyze the pattern of route selection and congestion from the previous rounds, aiming to minimize travel cost and regret.

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-R-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-R-D: 15 drivers
  - O-L-D: 3 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 110

### Regret Calculation
- Cost for O-R-D: \(210 + 10 \times 15 = 360\).
- Cost for O-L-D (if chosen): \(10 \times 3 + 210 = 240\).

Your regret is due to more drivers on O-R-D leading to higher costs compared to the fewer drivers on O-L-D which resulted in lower costs.

### Observations
- A majority chose O-R-D, leading to high congestion and costs.
- A smaller number of drivers chose O-L-D, resulting in appreciably lower costs.

### Pattern Recognition
1. **Alternating Route Selection**: Drivers tend to alternate based on previous congestion, attempting to avoid heavy traffic.
2. **Advantage in the Underserved Route**: Drivers who choose the lesser-populated route typically experience lower costs.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-L-D**: Given the previously observed pattern, a significant number of drivers might switch to O-L-D after high congestion on O-R-D, though there could still be fewer drivers moving there immediately.
2. **Capitalize on Less Utilized Path**: Align your choice where fewer drivers are expected to reduce travel costs and maximize your payoff.

### Decision
In order to optimize costs and minimize regret this round, I will select route **O-L-D**.

- Cost for O-L-D: \(10 \times 15 + 210 = 360\).
- Cost for O-R-D (if chosen): \(210 + 10 \times 3 = 240\).

The regret stems from the fact that choosing the less crowded O-R-D would have resulted in lower costs.

### Observations
- A majority chose O-L-D, resulting in higher costs due to congestion.
- Significantly fewer drivers chose O-R-D, leading to lower costs.

### Pattern Recognition
1. **Predictable Congestion**: Drivers often switch in reaction to congestion, creating an oscillatory pattern in route choice.
2. **Minority Route Advantage**: Historically, fewer drivers on a route means lower costs for those who choose it.

- Cost for O-R-D: \(210 + 10 \times 15 = 360\).
- Cost for O-L-D (if chosen): \(10 \times 3 + 210 = 240\).

Your regret reveals that fewer drivers on O-L-D led to a much lower cost compared to the choice of O-R-D.

### Observations
- A large number of drivers selected O-R-D, resulting in congestion and increased costs.
- O-L-D, with fewer drivers, emerged as the cheaper option.

### Pattern Recognition
1. **Switching Behavior**: Drivers tend to shift en masse to avoid congestion seen in the previous round, leading to oscillation.
2. **Benefit of Choosing the Less Crowded Route**: Consistently, fewer drivers on a route correlate with lower costs.

### Regret Calculation
- Cost for O-L-D: \(10 \times 15 + 210 = 360\).
- Cost for O-R-D (if chosen): \(210 + 10 \times 3 = 240\).

The regret shows clearly that choosing O-R-D, which was less crowded, would have minimized travel costs.

### Observations
- A significant majority of drivers chose O-L-D, creating considerable congestion.
- Minimal congestion on O-R-D resulted in lower costs for those drivers.

### Pattern Recognition
1. **Driver Switching:** Drivers typically react to previous outcomes, causing them to switch and oscillate between routes.
2. **Cost Efficiency of Minority Choice:** The route with fewer drivers generally offers better cost efficiency due to reduced congestion.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-R-D:** Since O-L-D was overcrowded, many drivers may shift away from it, although starting from 3 drivers last round offers a low baseline for O-R-D, making it attractive.
2. **Aim for Fewer Drivers:** Opt for the route expected to see fewer drivers this round, based on historical oscillations.

- Cost for O-R-D: \(210 + 10 \times 15 = 360\).
- Cost for O-L-D (if chosen): \(10 \times 3 + 210 = 240\).

The regret reflects that choosing O-L-D, which had significantly fewer drivers, was advantageous in terms of cost.

### Observations
- A majority leaned towards O-R-D, causing higher congestion and costs.
- Far fewer drivers on O-L-D resulted in lower costs.

### Pattern Recognition
1. **Behavioral Oscillation:** Drivers oscillate between routes as they respond to prior congestion, shifting in predictable patterns.
2. **Advantage of the Lesser-Chosen Route:** The less crowded route repeatedly shows a cost advantage.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-L-D:** With high congestion previously on O-R-D, it's reasonable to expect some drivers will now switch to O-L-D, yet not overwhelmingly so.
2. **Anticipate Lower Usage:** Choose the route that might remain less crowded, hence providing lower costs.

2. **Advantage of the Underserved Route**: Consistently, choosing the route with fewer drivers leads to cost benefits.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-R-D**: Given the previous congestion on O-L-D, it’s likely that drivers will start shifting towards O-R-D, yet it should still remain less congested if not all switch immediately.
2. **Position for Lower Congestion**: Opt for the route better anticipating fewer drivers based on historical oscillations.

### Decision
To minimize travel costs this round, I'll select the route **O-R-D**, aiming to utilize the predicted lower driver count effectively.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 14.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 15, 'O-L-D': 3}
  Your Regret: 110


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To select the best route for this round, we should carefully assess the recent distribution patterns and anticipate the decisions of other drivers to choose the route with potentially lower congestion.

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-R-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-R-D: 15 drivers
  - O-L-D: 3 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 110

### Regret Calculation
- Cost for O-R-D: \(210 + 10 \times 15 = 360\).
- Cost for O-L-D (if chosen): \(10 \times 3 + 210 = 240\).

The regret highlights that choosing O-L-D would have been less costly due to fewer drivers.

### Observations
- A majority of drivers opted for O-R-D, resulting in higher congestion and costs.
- Significantly fewer drivers on O-L-D yielded lower costs for those who chose it.

### Pattern Recognition
1. **Driver Oscillation**: Historically, drivers tend to switch routes based on previous congestion levels, often creating alternating congestion patterns.
2. **Benefit of Minority Choice**: Choosing the less congested route repeatedly results in cost advantages.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Consider O-L-D**: Given the increased congestion on O-R-D last round, O-L-D may now attract some drivers, but probably not enough to cause heavy congestion immediately.
2. **Planning Based on Patterns**: Align with the route likely to sustain lower traffic based on recent oscillations.

### Decision
In order to minimize costs effectively this round, I will select route **O-L-D**, where fewer drivers are anticipated, aiming for a cost-effective outcome.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 14.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
  Your Regret: 130


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To determine the best route for this round, let’s evaluate the behavioral patterns we've observed and anticipate driver movements to choose a route that offers minimal congestion and cost.

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-L-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-L-D: 16 drivers
  - O-R-D: 2 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 130

### Regret Calculation
- Cost for O-L-D: \(10 \times 16 + 210 = 370\).
- Cost for O-R-D (if chosen): \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 230\).

The regret indicates a cost advantage for choosing O-R-D due to fewer drivers.

### Observations
- Majority chose O-L-D, leading to high congestion and costs.
- Fewer drivers on O-R-D resulted in lower costs for those who chose it.

### Pattern Recognition
1. **Driver Response**: The tendency for drivers to react to congestion leads to predictable oscillations.
2. **Advantage of Minimal Congestion**: Routes with fewer drivers consistently offer lower costs due to reduced congestion.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-R-D**: Given the significant congestion on O-L-D, some drivers are likely to switch to O-R-D, which should still remain less crowded if not all switch immediately.
2. **Utilize Predictive Patterns**: Choose the route expected to have fewer drivers based on recent oscillation trends.

### Decision
To optimize costs and reduce regret, I will choose route **O-R-D**, aiming to benefit from lower expected congestion.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 14.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 16, 'O-L-D': 2}
  Your Regret: 130


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: Let's consider the decision-making process carefully to mitigate cost and minimize regret, based on the route choices and patterns we've observed:

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-R-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-R-D: 16 drivers
  - O-L-D: 2 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 130

### Regret Calculation
- Cost for O-R-D: \(210 + 10 \times 16 = 370\).
- Cost for O-L-D (if chosen): \(10 \times 2 + 210 = 230\).

The regret is indicative of choosing a heavily populated route, as O-L-D would have been cheaper.

### Observations
- O-R-D had a majority of drivers, resulting in high congestion and elevated costs.
- O-L-D had significantly fewer drivers, leading to lower associated costs.

### Pattern Recognition
1. **Switching Behavior**: Drivers tend to react to high congestion by switching routes, which causes route usage to oscillate.
2. **Minority Advantage**: The route with fewer drivers usually incurs lower travel costs.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-L-D**: Anticipate that drivers may move away from the congested O-R-D, leading to an increase on O-L-D, but it should still be less congested starting from a low base.
2. **Seek Less Congestion**: Choose the route likely to have less congestion, aiming for reduced travel costs.

### Decision
To mitigate costs and aim for the least congested route, I will choose route **O-L-D**.

```json
{"route": "O-L-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 14.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-L-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-L-D': 16, 'O-R-D': 2}
  Your Regret: 130


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To make an optimal decision for this round, let's analyze the past choices and adapt our strategy based on the observed oscillation patterns in driver distribution. 

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-L-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-L-D: 16 drivers
  - O-R-D: 2 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 130

### Regret Calculation
- Cost for O-L-D: \(10 \times 16 + 210 = 370\).
- Cost for O-R-D (if chosen): \(210 + 10 \times 2 = 230\).

The higher cost on O-L-D indicates that switching to O-R-D, which had fewer drivers, would have been more cost-effective.

### Observations
- Majority participation on O-L-D created heavy congestion and high travel costs.
- An underutilized O-R-D yielded lower costs due to minimal congestion.

### Pattern Recognition
1. **Cyclic Route Switching**: Drivers tend to move in herds away from previously congested routes, causing traffic to oscillate.
2. **Leverage the Less Crowded Route**: Consistently, routes with fewer drivers prove to minimize individual costs.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-R-D**: Given heavy congestion on O-L-D this round, expect some drivers to now migrate to O-R-D, although starting from a low base should still leave it less crowded.
2. **Cost Efficiency from Minimal Congestion**: Opt for the route less likely to be crowded to achieve lower travel costs.

### Decision
To optimize travel costs for this round, I will select route **O-R-D**, anticipating a more favorable number of drivers.

```json
{"route": "O-R-D"}
```

Human: You are agent 14.
Summary of previous round:
  Your Choice: O-R-D
  Route Choice Distribution: {'O-R-D': 16, 'O-L-D': 2}
  Your Regret: 130


Human: The available routes are: O-L-D, O-R-D.
Think step-by-step before making your decision.

LLM Output: To effectively choose a route this round, let's analyze previous decision patterns and aim for a strategic approach that minimizes congestion and cost.

### Summary of Previous Round
- **Your Choice**: O-R-D
- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-R-D: 16 drivers
  - O-L-D: 2 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 130

### Regret Calculation
- Cost for O-R-D: \(210 + 10 \times 16 = 370\).
- Cost for O-L-D (if chosen): \(10 \times 2 + 210 = 230\).

The regret shows that choosing O-L-D, with its fewer drivers, would have resulted in lower costs.

### Observations
- A majority opted for O-R-D, leading to high congestion.
- O-L-D was lightly used and thus much less costly.

### Pattern Recognition
1. **Oscillation in Choices**: There may be a tendency for drivers to switch from congested routes to less congested options, creating a cycling pattern.
2. **Maximize the Advantage of Low Crowds**: Historical outcomes favor the route with fewer drivers due to lower escalating costs.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-L-D**: Since O-R-D has been congested with a majority last round, many drivers might consider switching to O-L-D, but starting from low usage leaves room for advantage.
2. **Optimize for Lower Congestion**: Choose the route that historically has fewer participants, aiming for lower cost implications.

### Decision
To minimize costs and reduce regret this round, I will choose route **O-L-D**, expecting it to sustain lower driver density.

- Cost for O-L-D: \(10 \times 15 + 210 = 360\).
- Cost for O-R-D (if chosen): \(210 + 10 \times 3 = 240\).

The regret shows that selecting O-R-D, which had fewer drivers, would have resulted in lower costs.

### Observations
- Most drivers selected O-L-D, leading to high congestion and increased costs.
- Significantly fewer drivers used O-R-D, resulting in lower costs for those who chose it.

### Pattern Recognition
1. **Driver Switching Behavior**: Drivers often switch from a congested route to a less crowded one, creating a predictable oscillation.
2. **Cost Efficiency in Less Crowded Routes**: Opting for the route with fewer drivers generally results in lower travel expenses.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-R-D**: Given that O-L-D was congested in the last round, we can anticipate that some drivers may switch to O-R-D, but likely not enough to fully congest it immediately.

- Cost for O-R-D: \(210 + 10 \times 15 = 360\).
- Cost for O-L-D (if chosen): \(10 \times 3 + 210 = 240\).

The regret indicates that choosing O-L-D, with fewer drivers, would have led to a lower travel cost.

### Observations
- A significant majority chose O-R-D, leading to high congestion and costs.
- Fewer drivers on O-L-D resulted in a lower cost for that route.

- **Your Regret**: 90

### Regret Calculation
- Cost for O-L-D: \(10 \times 14 + 210 = 350\).
- Cost for O-R-D (if chosen): \(210 + 10 \times 4 = 250\).

The regret indicates that O-R-D, with fewer drivers, offered a significantly lower cost.

### Observations
- The majority of drivers chose O-L-D, resulting in higher congestion and costs.
- Fewer drivers chose O-R-D, leading to a lower cost for that option.

### Pattern Recognition

- **Route Choice Distribution**:
  - O-R-D: 14 drivers
  - O-L-D: 4 drivers
- **Your Regret**: 90

### Regret Calculation
- Cost for O-R-D: \(210 + 10 \times 14 = 350\).
- Cost for O-L-D (if chosen): \(10 \times 4 + 210 = 250\).

The regret shows that O-L-D was less crowded, resulting in a significantly lower cost.

### Observations
- Most drivers opted for O-R-D again, leading to high congestion and costs.
- Fewer drivers chose O-L-D, leading to lower costs for that route.

### Pattern Recognition
1. **Tendency for Collective Shift**: It seems drivers tend to move together toward an apparent less congested route, but the pattern can periodically shift.
2. **Predictability of Lesser Congestion**: The route less chosen tends to offer cost benefits due to fewer drivers.

### Suggested Strategy
1. **Switch to O-L-D**: Expecting some drivers reconsidering their choice due to last round's congestion on O-R-D, it's likely more will switch to O-L-D.
2. **Anticipate Fewer Drivers**: Position yourself on a route projected to see fewer drivers due to these oscillation patterns for cost benefits.
